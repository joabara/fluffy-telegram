2,Apple,"Apple M1 chip does not support two external Monitors Apple notebooks are great and work smoothly, however it is inconceivable that such an expensive and top machine does not support 2 external monitors such as the previous macbookair with intel chip does.On top of that there are only 2 USB C ports, so that any additional connection must come with expensive connectors.",2
3,Apple,What did you expect? It's a Mac! ,5
4,Apple,"great product so far, very happy with it. Very fast response, great screen quality- like it a lot so far.",5
5,Apple,Love it Great laptop,5
6,Apple,This MacBook Air is so fast and the screen is high quality. I ordered a mouse with the laptop but haven't even taken it out of the box because the trackpad is so good. The keyboard is sweet and I love the TouchId feature. I'm coming from a Windows background and this was so easy to set up. I'm so happy with it. The battery lasts a long time. Everything about this laptop is a breeze. Glad I took the plunge.,5
7,Apple,"Deeply disappointed I had tremendously high hopes for this CPU especially after reading the reviews of its 'speed', factually this is the slowest CPU I have ever used. The loading of web pages is truly pathetic, especially for 2021 and especially for the processor. The usual crap about speeding up the loading time is the usual garbage, 'clear the cache, is there enough room on the HD...' bla bla bla...' The damn thing is absurdly slow. The build quality is exceptional, the case is +, etc., and using the box offline is fine in terms of speed, but loading web pages, getting hung up on web pages, etc. is just plain BS. If anyone has any real advise on how to speed this thing up I would appreciate it but I am seriously thinking about returning it... My 2012 Lenova is actually faster. My INT is a fiber optics with plenty of juice...",3
8,Apple,"Beware!!! Dont buy from Amazon Warehouse Screen flickers at random and laptop crashes, lesson learned, amazon warehouse electronics are crap, had a very bad experience with other amazon warehouse buying.Laptop is good when it works, opens up fast, but I just ended up with a dud",1
9,Apple,"Incredible device for daily needs The device is silent because it has no fans, the screen isn't Oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts. The battery life is incredibly good I can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device. It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers, especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise, and if you don't use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop. It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use. If you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice.",5

21,Apple,not a MacBook Pro Ordered a MacBook Pro and got a MacBook Air!?!?!?,1
22,Apple,"My first Apple computer I just got my computer today, 08/19/21 I didn’t get to experience opening my box because my mom beat me to it but I love it I’m in love",5
23,Apple,"Amazing laptop but felt a little slow for some reason I purchased this laptop because my previous laptop (a behemoth of a gaming laptop) broke suddenly broke down. It was great, except for the fact that it felt a little slow. Maybe it is because I had downgraded from a 144hz screen to a 60hz screen, or maybe because my previous laptop was a performance monster, it just didn't feel that good. However, other than that, it is an amazing laptop. Very portable, and doesn't really heat up that much. Also, it charges super fast, therefore I could charge it for 30 min to 1 hour in the morning and go the the whole day without having to worry about charging it. Overall, it is an amazing product, however, it wasn't the one for me.",4
24,Apple,Producto dañado El producto con menos de 1 mes de uso se daño y la pantalla no enciende.,1
25,Apple,"Love It! After getting what I paid for in cheaper PCs only lasting a couple years at a time, I decided to switch to a Mac. This version with the new chip works well and was 200 dollars off when we got it. I also love the touch bar and hope they do not get rid of it permanently in future models.The 2020 MacBooks are great deal for the top notch performance the M1 chips have.",5
26,Apple,"Unreliable AND Issues with MS 365 I wish I had purchased from AppleScreen will pixilize and reboot for no reason, taken it to the GB twiceConflict with Microsoft OneDrive that is unresolved, in the new chipLots of issues, the one where you're working and it flakes out and reboots is a pain and no one knows why",1
27,Apple,No idea Unfortunately un reviewable return activity???,1
28,Apple,"Love the screen color I really like my purchase of the MacBook Pro. It is super fast. The colors on the screen are bright & clear. I love the the 13 inch screen. It’s the perfect size for me. Since it didn’t have any usb plug ins I bought me a hub for it that has usb, hdmi, slot for memory card & it has 3.0. Love this Mac. Would recommend it.",5
29,Apple,This Macbook screen have four blue point on top and right side. Also Box open very bad smell. This Macbook screen have four blue point on top and right side. Also Box open very bad smell.,3

31,Apple,"It’s a good purchase Got this for college, it works pretty well it’s worth more than what I paid for lol only things if you can get more than 128G",5
32,Apple,Perfect for the price $ This was exactly what I needed to tie together all of my Apple products and I couldn’t be happier. I was extremely worried about purchasing a refurbished computer but so far I’M IN LOVE!!! Everything is perfect!!!,5
33,Apple,MacBook Air The MacBook Air arrived in excellent condition. There was not a scratch or mar any where on the device. I would highly recommend buying from this seller.,5
34,Apple,need problem fixed Having problems with it I brought it for my daughter and it has been acting up since we received it is there anything you can do about this problem spent a good amount of money on it,1
35,Apple,"Great buy! Fast delivery, great value for the money!",5
36,Apple,Laptop with charger The laptop is fine but the charger didn't work. It was disappointing to have to buy a new charger when this laptop was to have one that actually works.,3
37,Apple,"Dont buy! omacbook came with defective battery.It doesn't hold charge, sometimes it's 50% and you put the charger and it automatically goes to 7%.It heats up too much, the bottom is extremely high and makes noise",1
38,Apple,Little disappointed Slower than I hoped.Downloads are really slow.,3
39,Apple,Value for your money. Looked great right out of the box.,5
40,Apple,Daughter loves it Good for the price,5
41,Apple,Luv it I was skeptical about buying a Amazon renewed Mac was pleasantly surprised and impressed looks & works like brand new picture is beautiful,5
42,Apple,So disappointed Product just arrived it’s all scratched up and so far it’s not powering on I’m so upset,1
43,Apple,"Mac book I love it , its just so goodit feels new like its great and worth every dime and its so cheap for a mac book but I really recommend i love it but everyone experience will be different. ( TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF because the will be GOOD reviews and BAD ONES test it out for yourself but i love it )",5
44,Apple,"Product doesn't work I purchased this and it doesn't even work the screen keeps blanking out when I try to turn the computer off, what a rip off",1
45,Apple,Fabulous! Great laptop.Everything that I need it for and then some!,5
46,Apple,Love it Great computer,5
47,Apple,They sent this computer with a charger that doesn’t correspond to the computer. ,1

49,Apple,Perfect. Basically brand new.,5
50,Apple,Value for money Battery life is extraordinary,5
51,Apple,Buena inversión Excelente,5
52,Apple,Great budget MacBook Works pretty well. Haven’t had many issues with it other than the charger not charging the MacBook when plugged in and I didn’t receive the MagSafe charger it stated it’ll come with but other wise it’s been a great MacBook so far.,4
53,Apple,LOVE IT GREAT SO FAR,5
54,Apple,extremely surprised!!!! I was really unsure about the purchase given that its renewed but it looks and works like new so far. a 1400$ computer for 500$ is a steal.,5
55,Apple,Worth it. I was nervous about getting this refurbished laptop and after reading the reviews it looked liked I had a 50/50 chance. Turned out awesome. Get one. If anything Amazon will replace it if it’s a no go.,5
56,Apple,Not worth the money Battery life is awful,1
57,Apple,Perfect Timing I received it today and it looks brand new . Very well packed and even came with a cover . My favorite color as well. Thanks 👍🏼I got it all set up and runs very smoothly!Olga,5
58,Apple,Works Amazingly AMAZINGit is basically brand new and works perfect! I use it to play Minecraft and the sims 4 and it’s not laggy even with the hundreds of custom content I have for the sims. 10/10 would definitely recommend,5
59,Apple,Superb New-Like Quality Excellent product! Exactly like new! I am VERY impressed!,5
60,Apple,Macbook air The product is great so far i have no complaints with their work! luv the quality and it functions very well.,5
61,Apple,Quality product This laptop was in great condition. Functions properly and has nothing cosmetically wrong with it. Pretty much a brand new computer.,5
62,Apple,"It works good this product, I just love it. I am happy with the product, my wife love it.",5
63,Apple,"Clean, reliable & just what i needed Upgraded & maxxed out the RAM immediately and this thing runs like a top.I don't have a single complaint.",5
64,Apple,Dont do it These revamped laptops are 10 years old. Mine became so hot after an hour of setup time. Also the battery says it needs immediate service. I can purchase a decent brand new HP or Acer for this price with up to date programs. Never Again.,1
65,Apple,Like new Product very good just a bit slow still happy,4
66,Apple,Great Product This was a purchase for my brother.He has no complaints & I wish I would have gotten one for myself.,5
67,Apple,Delivered on time ,5
68,Apple,Everything is ok Everything is ok,5
69,Apple,"MacBook Pro This is a nice product I highly recommend buying here received my product in a timely manner, it was sleek, what’s more nice they even added in a free protective covering, you could keep it or take off. But the system it self looks well and clean money well spent I’d say.",5
70,Apple,Works great Arrived quick and no issues so far.,5
71,Apple,Cant even tell it’s refurbished Paying $285 is way better than over a thousand. It works very well. Battery life might be a little bit lower than a new one but everything else is the same.,5
72,Apple,"Macbook Pro 13 mid 2012 almost brand new Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The computer was delivered before the expected date, just few minor scratches nothing important almost brand new appearance, so far it’s working normally, new power supply new screen, value for money it’s good, it’s not a touch screen.",5
73,Apple,"Solid Laptop for High School Kid’s School Requirements Much cleaner, durable, and better ergonomics than Chrome Books.Daughter able to access all required Google Classroom features. Printing integrates well. Seller very responsive and sent me correct power cable overnight. Excellent product and responsive service.",5
74,Apple,"Dents in the inside of computer Looked great on the out side, but when opened lid dents all over the inside.",2
75,Apple,"Like new! This was a birthday gift for my 14yr old daughter and she was ecstatic!It is like new , but as expected she is on it all the time:(.",5
76,Apple,No issues Very satisfied,5
77,Apple,Item keep shutting down Laptop received was defective. Keep shutting down while in use. I a extremely disappointed with the purchase. I will be seeking a reimbursement.,1
78,Apple,"Pésima compra Pésima compra, llego con la batería mala, se apagaba y me podía batería cuando tenía 50% de carga",1
79,Apple,Would purchase another. Excellent condition.Works great!,5
80,Apple,woulda gave more stars it was clean no scratches it was like new until having plugged in to charge an battery wouldn’t charge so i have to send back for replacement,2
81,Apple,Esperaba más de Amazon El cable de carga tiene mucho uso un poco sucio el MAC cumple la función pero esperaba un poco más de Amazon,3
82,Apple,Bricked. No operating system! I spent an hour on the phone with Apple support and this MacBook Air has no operating system installed. This is not Apple certified refurbished!,1
83,Apple,"You won’t be disappointed! I hesitantly bought this laptop as I have had bad experiences with refurbished purchases in the past. However, this has exceeded my expectations so far. The laptop has very minimal surfaces scratches that you really have to look for to find, and mostly on the bottom. It came well packaged, include do all the parts listed, started up immediately, is charging and holding a charge, and came with Catalina iOS. It honestly looks like it was barely even used previously. I would definitely buy another laptop through this seller again.",5
84,Apple,Wonderful as a student I love this I’m using this computer is solely for education and I love it so much,5
85,Apple,"This is not worth purchasing Screen brightness doesn’t adjust, volume buttons don’t work, processer is way slower than it should be, this is an all around rip off and I should get a refund!!!!",1
86,Apple,"Temper your expectations I expected some damage. I mean these are old, old machines and it wouldn't be realistic to get a brand new pristine one, especially at this price. Now with all that being said, when they say these things may have superficial damage they weren't lying. Mine came with a bent frame as shown in picture 3. Overall despite the damage it still works, well so far at least. Oh and what's most important is that the screen and keyboard seem fine. I'm currently installing Big sur on it and will report back if I run into any issues.EDIT: Upon using this for a little over a week I've found that the screen has a tiny crack near the center. Now a small crack is not a huge deal, but it's compounding the issue of feeling somewhat ripped off. This unit also gets unbearably hot sometimes. Overall I'm quite unsatisfied.",2
87,Apple,Good Good Supm I must say a BIG thank you to the provider who went out the way to correct my address in the situation I was in.. You came through and now I have this beautiful device sitting in my lap. Thank you a million.,5
88,Apple,"Battery life is bad I really like this laptop but there's thus line on it that I'm sort of worried about, the battery runs down too fast, it gets really hot very quickly, and sometimes freezes.",3
89,Apple,Amazing buy! This MacBook has been AMAZING! It works perfectly and I am so pleased with how easy it was to catch on to!,5
90,Apple,"What I like most about using a MAC instead of Windows I love my MAC computer, it is lightning fast even when connected to my hotspot on my iPhone when I'm not near WIFI. the battery life is OK but wish is could last longer, other than that, I'm 955 happy with my purchase",5
91,Apple,Condition and performance Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Great product I'm truly satisfied with the condition and performance no cosmetic scratches,5
92,Apple,"The computer stopped working So it’s been only two months and the holly Mac is not working anymore. Right it doesn’t turn on anymore, the screen is totally black and when I plug the charger in, it is still not working. The light of the charging be changing from green to orange, and it turns off and it goes green or orange again 😪 I am really sad because why????It was all perfect, I was in love bug now? I just don’t know what happened :((((",4
93,Apple,". Product came in with a few dings and scratches, but that was expected. I was mainly worried about the screen being cracked but looks like i got a good one. Device is exactly what was ordered and i can't complain. If you're looking for a Macbook but don't want to spend the money on a new, take the gamble and try your luck.",4
94,Apple,"On Time Delivery of a Non-Usable Computer The computer shipped and arrived as hoped, however I wasn't able to get it set up beyond the ""create a username and password"" screen due to keys sticking on the computer. The ""U"" key would place multiple ""u"" 's, the ""shift"" key would not capitalize letters unless hit many times and with a firm touch. I bought this computer for very detailed letter and font work and I can't get past the prompts to start it up. Very disappointed, and I wouldn't rely on a working computer from this business.",1
95,Apple,"Not worth the price The laptop was pretty good, it looked brand new as soon as I opened it. But, the main problem I had with this laptop was the camera. It was not working at all and I unfortunately have to now go get the whole screen replaced just to fix the camera problem.",3
96,Apple,Worth Every Penny Your browser does not support HTML5 video. For the money I spent on this was around $700 after taxes it was on sale and worth every penny. I feel as if I purchased a open boxed MacBook because there are no marks or anything cosmetically wrong with it.The only down side to me is the charger. I would like an Apple charger instead but for the money I paid I like it. It came in a bubble wrap. Puff type thing and it was charged well. The battery like and count are very low. The count is 36 and I can get 1000 out of this laptop. So worth it.,5
97,Apple,"Great product for money This is a super-high quality laptop, it arrived looking spotless and the screen is brilliant, and it looks like it could have been brand new. The only issue is that the battery is a little less than perfect, it lasts about 4 hours at max with normal browsing activity. When purchasing a computer, many people ask the question: ""Can it run Minecraft?"" Well, this computer can run Minecraft, and very well at that, with around 60 fps average. However, do not expect to be able to play Minecraft on battery life, because the battery will only last around an hour and a half and the fans start blowing like crazy and it gets all hot.Also, the first day I had the computer, the smaller part of the charger wall port broke and I messaged the seller and they eventually sent me a new one. But this one also broke eventually, so I guess the AC adaptors from this year are kind of low quality. So I got an older AC adaptor and it works like a charm and is a lot more high quality.Overall this is a very good laptop andis well worth the money. People always think I am rich now when they see me with this computer even though it was only $650.",5
98,Apple,ITS A MUST Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Everything I asked for!,5
99,Apple,Unsatisfied and disappointed. I recently purchased a Macbook Pro retina touchbar for my first laptop. The screen coincidentally gave out directly after the 90 day warranty. The seller has no interest in assisting being that i spent over $800 for one of their products. Overall unsatisfied and disappointed. Im looking at a $600 repair for a faulty display cord that should’ve been in good condition.,1
100,Apple,Macbook Pro.... There is no lag time! This macbook is amazing!,5
101,Apple,N/A Very bad,1
102,Apple,"amazing! amazing buy! runs super smoothly and im really glad i bought. few scratches on the bottom of laptop and the charger, but besides that i am very pleased (:",5
103,Apple,Quick sending It came in a very good packaging. It came before due date. They were very kind through email. Great buying and it was worth it. I’m super happy,5
104,Apple,Great Buy ,5
105,Apple,Excellent Mac Excellent product. Very accomplished supplier,5
106,Apple,"Value for your dollar if you don’t need a shiny new model. I needed a newer laptop to work while I travel, my last one died October last year. This totally fit the bill and in the right price range. No trouble yet and quite happy with this purchase. Was not in the market for spending the cost for a new MacBook, if I get a couple of years out of this unit, then money well spent.",4
107,Apple,Excellent MacBook is like new. 10/10 would recommend,5
108,Apple,"Muy buen producto por un muy bajo precio Puedo decir que el estado de la computadora es perfecto, casi nuevo , hay que acercarse mucho para notar algunos pequeños rasguños pero al trabajar con ella se siente perfectamente como si se estuviese trabajando en un equipo nuevo. Perfecta compra, buen precio, muy recomendado para los que no tengan miles de dólares para una super MacBook Pro 16 nueva y este buscando un monstruo de trabajo por menos de la mitad de precio.",5
109,Apple,"Deben detallar mejor el estado del equipos El teclado no era el americano qwerty si no era azerty.Tenia gastado el lado derecho de la base como un piquetes. ( en la foto se pued apreciar mejor )En la descripción decia que tenia un procesador I7 2.9 y el que llego era 2.8 hzPero todo lo demas estaba bien, enecendia rapido, duracion de bateria bien, patalla bien ( un poco de marcas dem teclado, pero es normar ) cable y cargador bien.Lo devolvi por el teclado, me molestaba mucho. Era confuso, aunque al configurarlo al español, funcionaba sin problemas.",3
110,Apple,"Fair for the price I was skeptical but the laptop is in good condition, except for some scratches, a dent on the left side on the screen near the hinge and some kind of deformation on the bottom cover.",4
111,Apple,functionality issues Only because I was on a very tight deadline did I feel the need to return the unit.If I didn't have to go out and purchase unit locally the seller seems reliable and did their best to resolve the issue but I was already behind schedule on the project.So time didn't allow that luxury.Had we been able to I would have loved this unit.Gorgeous look to it and potentially very powerful.I have non issues with the seller.They did the best they couldunder the circumstance.It happens.,4
112,Apple,LOOKS BRAND NEW I am so pleased with this purchase. There is nothing about this laptop that says used.The Apple Geek Squad gave it the thumbs up on working properly.I could not ask for more.,5
113,Apple,"Good computer, not a great buy. I received mine in two days after shipping, had a defect charger with it, had to order another charger. Will not update,because doesn’t have memory space. Check around, no simple way of getting more memory. Ok for the money.",3
114,Apple,Works great Satisfied,5
115,Apple,"Affordable Option for a nice Computer I was hesitant to order due to the reviews but I am very pleased with my purchase. The computer arrived in excellent condition, doesn't even look used! The ONLY complaint is the battery life. It is clear this battery will not last more than an hour. It does have to stay on the power cord, but I don't have an issue with that as I needed an affordable computer while my work laptop is being ordered. The quality of packaging was also great. The device came well packed. I would recommend this seller, just know that the battery or external shell may not be in the best shape.",4
116,Apple,"Muy buen articulo, muy bien. Muy buen artículo, solo algunas rayas en la carcasa , hasta el momento el Mac a funcionado muy bien, la batería está muy bien.",5
117,Apple,It didn’t work It didn’t work and so happy to get it and it doesn’t work,1
118,Apple,Horrible This Macbook came on and would freeze up. I had to restart several times. Then I turned it on the final time and it appeared as though it had been cleared of its software or something. It would only show a question mark when I turned it on. I googled the message and that is what the question mark stood for. Something about a disk reload. Apparently this one had not fully been refurbished.Amazon it supposed to refund me my money. The price was good but maybe a little to good.,1
119,Apple,"Not perfect, but pretty good This is the 2nd refurbished Mac I've bought from Amazon.It works great for my needs, I'm sure if you are a coder or gamer you may need the new features.However, for the money this is a great MacBook that works well and looks great.",5
120,Apple,Lasted just past return window. Not worth it. I waited to review. Product pretty new in appearance couple scratches nbd. Lasted one month after return window and now it won’t turn on for $400+ i should have just bought a new one.FML,1
121,Apple,Do NOT Buy I was expecting the laptop to work well. Ordered and was delivered earlier than expected. I was like “great”. Looked at laptop and noticed a weird sticker on the top and bottom “hmm”. Plugged in laptop and it refuses to turn on. I feel scammed. I would give it 0 stars if possible.,1
122,Apple,Decent for the price but the mouse touchpad is a mess. Pretty much what you’d expect from a $300 refurbished laptop. The mouse touchpad screws up so much that I had to buy a wired mouse to use instead. A few of the keys on the keypad are worn out and have to be hit pretty firmly to work.,3
123,Apple,"Yes it has dings but it's still a great purchase. I'll admit I was worried. I expected a disaster. In the end I was happy. Here's why... The unit arrived well packaged. It's a silver 13 inch MacBook air 2015 model with 8gb ram 256gb hdd. Almost new looking. It has minor scratches on the bottom hardly visible. The corners are slightly bent on top and bottom as if taken dings while closed. The charging terminal looks it's age slightly worn metal with some minor mineral damage but functions fine. The battery life seems good to me. The actual charger cable is brand new. Once powered on, everything looks amazing. All lights function, keys look clean and readable, screen is Crystal clear no scratches at all. The touch pad impeccable. The specs check out when verified in about this Mac. It was running OS high Sierra and after upgrading to BigSur the experience is just top notch. The garage band looks like logicprox and the imovie looks like finalcutpro. These 2 small programs impressed me since I own a studio with the professional programs running on Macmini. I know what they look like. I connected an M-audio Keystation to this MacBook and was able to make beautiful beats right away. So overall I'm happy with the quality. This machine would cost $1,500 to a little more than $2k easy in today's model. So I saved allot of money and got more than I expected.",4
124,Apple,"Really good refurbished MacBook Air. Came factory reset, and full memory. Was as described. I’d probably order again if had to. Looks brand new, but already can tell it’s a older MacBook",3
125,Apple,"So far so good This was a great buy, i always wanted a macbook but i didn’t want to pay 1k+ and for this to be super fast , easy to set up , and no dents , no scratches and no cracks is good i’ve had it for 2 days now and everything is running great !",5
126,Apple,Really awesome Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I think it’s great came in amazing condition can finally play my sims,5
127,Apple,Refurbished = good as new! This Mac air is terrific. What I appreciate most is the extended battery life.,5
128,Apple,Came right on time Item came super fast was a gift for my son and he loves it,5

130,Apple,"Excelente producto, Llego en perfectas condiciones, parece nuevo.",5
131,Apple,It was packaged correctly and well worth the money The product works like new. There was a mixup on the delivery service side. I contacted the seller and they quickly took care of it for me. I would definately buy from them again.,5

133,Apple,"Superior build quality, superior performance, superior sound. Simply superior. Apple did a great job with this machine. The quality and performance are amazing. I'd purchased a high-spec Windows-based machine to give Win10 a try but the streaming ads in my workspace and the overall clutter simply were not worth the marginally 'lower' price. This new Macbook Pro delivers value and performance, which in turn gives me the power to do the same with my work.",5

136,Apple,"Got this in February 21 It is good. I'll start with that. This is my second Apple laptop. I got the m1 in December, just a bit before this one.My M1 is my personal device and the 16 I7 16gb 512 ram is my work deviceHistorically i use Linux and Windows. Which i still think are fantastic.I am a developer:I do Java/node/JVM languages C++. Historically i've done a lot of different development: Android, OS/system, C# etc. I'm pointing this out so you know what i might be evaluating it on.I needed Intel, this device, for work where compatibility is important, and the device can be managed by Intune with a virus scanner.Here are mythoughts if you are thinking about this now.Applemakes some of the best laptops i 've used. The main thing is the build quality, and how everything works. It's the details it's truly a joy to use. There are windows laptops that IMO are this good. Like High end dells, and Lenovo come to mind, lot of the gaming laptops are better for most people. at least in a lot of ways. That said i'm a big fan of the metal design and in particular the rigidity of this one.Other stand outs- screen-sound- incredible build quality on everything including the powersupply. I truely don't think Apple gets all the credit they deserve on value. Yes, these computers cost a lot of money, however i've purchased computers for years, and frankly i mostly build them myself because of the crap manufactures put in them. You can totally get good windows /linux laptops but you must sift though a lot. Even the powersupply alone i would use with any computer that can get by on 100w. Not to dwell on that but i'm just trying to say take it from someone that knows a lot about computers the quality is fantastic. These days you can easily hold onto these computers for a decade. IN addition, apple supports the product with a long time windows, and it is easy to get parts after the fact. I am annoyed you can't upgrade the ram and storage. It would be nice if they provided such an option. I would have paid 20% more at least on my M1.Usage I'm a power user. I run these extremely hard. I've written about 200 tbw to the drive in 6 months.Coding, engineering, productivity. Long hours very hard.Now i'll tell you what i think.-The battery isn't that great. It lasts me about 4 hours.- these get too hot. The metal body really transfers the heat and it can be unfomfortable and loud. It throttles in warm weather. The intel CPU just generates too much heat for this formfactor.- the ram upgrade is too expensive and i don't feel that software development at least what i'm doing I have enough ram. Granted this was a config options, but due to the cost work capped me. For this cost they should come with 32 at this cost. Generally thismachine is underpowerd. For this cost they shoudl hav had better cooling or even a vapor chamber. i opened it up and took a look. The cooling pipes are subpar. My G14 has much better cooling, and it is smaller with a lot more power.I own a G14(asus gaming laptop, and an M1) I prefer both to this computer. They have more power (perform better) and have much better battery life.I need to use this though because it is the only os based on ""unix' that is compatible with my IT department. If i were buying an Apple computer i'd seriously consider the m1 at this point or wait for a larger version if that's what you need. Or get the air m1, and a good windows laptop if i need to do mac stuff. The m1s are much better value for the perf.This isn't a bad computer, but it is underpowered for the money and gets too hot.",4
137,Apple,Apple is always expensive. I use it for production so I can not complain. Had it for about a year and half now. Its withstanding the test of time so far. No problems whatsoever. Hopefully it stays this way. 🤞🏾,5
138,Apple,"Zero imperfections Flawless front, back and screen. Still getting used to working with an MacBook but it is very fast and looks brand new.",5
139,Apple,"Expensive garbage Lets see: They changed something so my vim/tmux shortcuts no longer work right and have to hack around it. Constantly brush touchbar and get unwanted behavior. Apple replaced bash with zsh screwing up other things with my development setup. The thing spontaneously starts playing youtube video (if open in the browser) when I put it in my backback and start walking. Comes awake after I put it to sleep and close it, running down the battery. Just a barrel of frustrations for a premium price.",1
140,Apple,"Dead after 18 months. This is my third Mac—both of my others lasted 6-8 years and I’ve never had any problems with them. This one has a host of problems—I’ve spent probably a full 24 hours with Apple support over the last year trying to get it fixed. The SMS processor had to be reset, the keyboard is defective, and then the battery died so it’s completely dead after 18 months. I would not buy a pro. Since my last iPhone didn’t even last two years I’m rethinking becoming a PC at age 40. So disappointing. The product quality declined so quickly without Jobs.",1
141,Apple,"Performs As Advertised Using for business and music and its been fine. I have been an Apple supporter for a long time and have been fine with the Intel chips.

142,Apple,"Get enough RAM before hand...It isn't upgradable. The only thing that I disliked about the computer is that the RAM is soldered on the motherboard and is non-upgradable.Make sure that you get the amount of RAM that you will require, because it's not like in the old days where you can crack it open and throw in some RAM.Other than that, it's a great computer at a fair price.",5

150,Apple,It's worth it. When I receive it the charger did not work so I had to buy a charger. Then I have to get into Apple/iTunes world . It's been good apart from normal transfer from Windows to Apple .,4
151,Apple,DON’T BUT THIS COMPUTER! they advertise this computer as a 2018 when it’s a 2012 MacBook. The charger didn’t last long and it’s supposed to last 10 hours when it only lasted 1 hour. When i would look up something it would just keep referring and would never actually open up the site.,1

155,Apple,"Excellent PC, BUT Need More Ports!!!!!! Dell and Apple are are creating an entire secondary market required for plugging things into their products. Even if they designed and manufactured these multi port dongle’s that would be acceptable. Simply providing one or two very high speed ports causes consumers to research third-party solutions to interface to their existing or new peripherals; where these multi port solutions often do not inter-operate properly. Unacceptable!!!!!",1
156,Apple,"Great performance and features battery life is a lie Loved the Responsiveness clarity touch intuitive screen. Hated the four if I’m lucky five hour battery life even though they advertise 14+ hours, Felt like I’ve been lied to. The unit gets so hot that shutting the computer off on a full charge the fan stays on until the battery is drained flat. My full charge battery when I shut it down doesn’t even have enough charge to boot the computer up after sitting on a desk overnight. After reading the forums of people having the same issue it really feels like Dell has outright deceived people on the battery life and sold a product that doesn’t even live up to the basic laptop purpose of being remote usage reliably. I did purchase the XPS 9310 2 in 1 with the terabyte solid-state drive",1
157,Apple,"DO NOT BUY Horrible, worked well for a bit, then overheated to the point where I couldn't touch it, screen kept freezing and had to restart the computer, this happened like 5 times in a single day, I stopped using the computer after that.

226,HP,"Read reviews before buying, might be perfect for me but not you If you are someone who needs to use applications on this laptop to do work, this laptop is not for you. Normal Microsoft Office usage is not a problem, but I mean gaming applications like Minecraft, or other software for animation, video editing, etc. The storage on this laptop is too small to run those kinds of applications. In honesty, I would recommend investing in a laptop with high RAM for those kinds of things. The free year of Microsoft Office is a bonus, but I'd honestly just used a web-based service like Google Docs or the online Microsoft Suite (changing the settings to work offline). Using web-based applications will help the laptop run faster and work better.This laptop is ultimately best for surfing the web, social media, or writing papers. The storage space is not fit for anything else.As for the portability of this laptop, it's great. It's lightweight and very thin for it's price (on top of aesthetically pleasing!). It is NOT touchscreen -- the listing mentions that it's not touchscreen but the Amazon reviews prompt asked me to write about it. As for battery life, it's fine and lasts a while if you're using it for basic tasks like writing or surfing the web, which is what this laptop was made for anyways. I've only had it off the charger 4 times, so I can't speak on longevity, but it's lasted when I've had the laptop off the charger. I'd recommend this laptop for those who are looking to do basic laptop tasks or someone who is new to technology.My tips to make the most of this laptop and make it work with your budget:1) Uninstall bloatware and any unneeded apps like Netflix, Skype, etc2) I recommend using the browser version of apps like Netflix, Zoom, WebEx, etc instead of installed versions -- both require internet but one takes up significantly less storage3) clear cache often4) get a wireless mouse",5

If I'm not using it, it's lasted anywhere from 4-7 days per charge (if the battery is full). If I am using it for like games or other stuff it still lasts a while. I've been on games for at least 3 hours or so and the battery is only down a little so it's definitely worth the purchase as a good first laptop for simple tasks and simple work.",5

The full size keyboard is very functional although please note the silver keys are a little difficult to see under certain lighting conditions. The keyboard backlighting is very helpful for this issue.She uses this laptop for business applications including MS Office apps and it's perfect for those purposes. Since we're not into gaming, can't answer if this laptop is suited for that.The seller, PConline365, provided very fast shipping of the unit.I contacted them directly via phone for a technical question regarding the computer and they responded very quickly with the answer to my question.I would confidently buy from PConline365 again and I can recommend them for your purchases!",5

266,HP,"Horrible experience. warranty issues, Device issues. WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS ITEM CALL HP TO CONFIRM IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A FULL YEAR WARRANTY ON THE COMPUTER!I don't even know where to start... but ill try to make a long story short. I purchased this item and it was delivered to me quickly. However upon starting up the computer (THE SAME DAY I RECEIVED IT) a blue screen error popped up on the laptop. everyone knows when you get the blue screen notice there's gonna be issues with the device. There are different blue screen errors in general.The error one I got was ""CRICTICAL STRUCTURE CORRUPTION"" (SEE PHOTO I ATTACHED)This means there is an issue with the hardware inside of the computer.At this point I'm super pissed because how is this happening the FIRST day I received the item?what hardware issue could there possibly be with a ""NEW"" computer?Inside of the laptop box there was a HP customer service number so I called to see if the issue could be fixed. before I even got that far they mentioned to me that my warranty was 6 months in! How could my""NEW""laptop's warranty be 6 months in when I just bought the computer AND GOT IT TODAY??? I'm supposed to have a full year on the warranty. I wish I looked at the other reviews because they mentioned the same thing about the warranty being used and another reviewer about the blue screen error he had.ALWAYS READ THE REVIEWS THROUGHLY BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER GUYS! CALL HP TO CONFIRM IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A FULL YEAR WARRANTY ON THE COMPUTER even if your not having issues with the device.Anyways.. with the blue screen and the warranty being half used I was officially over it. The hardware issue couldn't be fixed over the phone so I just returned the laptop for a full refund.I'm writing this review from a laptop I purchased somewhere else.",1

However, when I registered the PC with HP, it indicated that the warranty began running on 12/13/2020 and will expire on 01/16/2022. I'm now involved with a warranty dispute with HP. I'm not sure if this is an HP issue or if it has to do with the seller. I don't think that this is a used machine (it was sold as new). However, something is fishy about this. I'll give HP a few days to respond. If it's not resolved, I suppose that I'll next go to Amazon and failing resolution there, I'll return the PC and order from another supplier.6/17/2021 Update I was finally able to work my way through the HP bureaucracy to get me warranty updated to reflect my actual purchase date.

316,Acer,"Great Laptop for the price Great laptop overall, love the display, has decent hardware. Display is great although you have to adjust saturation of the display. Performance is great not super fast but for a budget laptop its fine. Battery easily last 8 hrs or more depending on what task your doing. The laptop is completely fanless, this to me is a huge plus, less noise and not having to clean the cooling fan often due to dust building up inside the case. I would say my only complaint is for some weird reason the sound quality especially using youtube watching videos the sound is extremely low, but based on my research this is due to some setting call ""enhancement"" removed in the realtek driver version that allows a feature called loudness equalization, its not terrible but can be louder. My suggestion is if you going to use this laptop disable windows s mode, its very limited, havent noticed a difference in performance after turning this off. There is also a slot to upgrade the 4 gb of ram that comes built in the device. If you purchase it would be wise to upgrade the 4GB of ram to at least 8GB for a boost in performance.",4
317,Acer,Its super slow I thought it would be a good computer for my office but its not its real laggy and it froze on me,2
318,Acer,Lasted only five weeks before it stopped working.Currently in for repair. I have a 10 yr old Acer which is still working albeit very slowly so I decided I was safe in purchasing another Acer.Normally I buy electronics from Costco or some brick and mortar store but this time since it was Acer I purchased through Amazon.Oh how I regret this decision.First tech support at Acer - Jonathan - was helpful and set up a case number but his cure didn’t last.I called again the next day and spoke with someone called Mary.Unfortunately I am hard of hearing and wear a hearing aid and Mary is not a native English speaker.I truly could not understand a word she said.She couldn’t understand me either because even though I spelled my name five times she still got it really wrong.Not sure how she qualified as a support person.She ended call but I didn’t know it was being ended until I realized she’d hung up.Then I received an email on how to send the laptop in for repair.$31 later it was on its way.Three days ago received email that it was repaired and being returned to me.Email stated that I would receive a second email with tracking number.Still waiting.I’d really just like my money back.Would really appreciate being contacted by an Acer rep who speaks clearly.,1
319,Acer,"Excellent performance but not for gamers I got this machine when I had an issue with with my Acer Nitro 5. I was looking for something cheap while I get a new keyboard for the Nitro. Three things about this Acer, no backlit keyboard, no touchscreen and also true of the Nitro there is no cap lock indicator light. USB, network speed and disk response are all good though not a lot of space on the disk, cloud storage recommended. Windows S mode is provided but can be easily changed although I see no point because of the limited graphics. Tried a few outside games and not happy with the performance. I really think this would be fine left in S mode and used by casual users or students. This one will replace my wives machine when I am done with it. Its heads above her old one in performance. The game collection on the Microsoft store performs well here just not mainstream games due to lack of dedicated GPU.",4
320,Acer,"Backlit keyboards against black keys works fine I originally ordered another brand of laptop that used a silver case and silver keyboard.The screen reflection on silver keys made the keys unreadable, even with backlighting.

327,Acer,Only One Ram Slot Upgradable on the Ryzen 3 3550u Version and Missing Screws They changed the internal design on the Ryzen 3 3550u version and I didn't know about it. They removed 1 of the ram slots and 1 is now soldered on so both ram sticks can't be upgraded like the Ryzen 3 3200u version. I was under the impression that both slots were upgradable since Acer America replied to 2 customer questions saying that both memory slots are upgradable but they likely were taking about another version that was listed. This led me to spend $70 extra for 2 8gb sticks that I didn't need. Also the battery isn't even screwed in!,1

331,Acer,"Glad it exists, works nicely, but has disappointing flaw I love Window S-Mode especially for young and old less tech savvy people, and internet research points that require less maintenance. In fact I wish manufacturers would make their more powerful (CPU) models available in Windows S for use cases such as young and old less tech savvy people that still want to edit pictures and videos.However - this model by Acer has an issue that is disappointing. All edges match perfectly, so it is quite difficult to open! There is no indent to separate the clamshell. Very very weird as an outcome from designers in todays age.==== FYI ====Aspire 5 A515-46-R14K / AMD Ryzen 3 3350U / 4GB / 128GB1) This model has 1 open DDR Ram slot. I put an 8GB unit it in for a new total of 12GB.2) This model has a completely empty 2.5"" hard disk slot to accept an SSD. The drive mount and connection wire come separately in the box (which I found odd).3) The internal drive is a user replaceable M.2 drive.4) Rear panel removes easily by removing rear screws and carefully and evenly prying the seam with plastic phone pry bar.ADVICE FOR ACER5) Acer, please make an indent to allow for easy opening.6) Please sell better CPU's with Windows-S and larger built-in RAM. Would be nice to have an i5/i7 with 16GB of ram for young people or old people, less tech savvy that want to edit their videos on the laptops.7) There is space the the left of the battery and under the optional SSD area that is empty. Add some more M.2 drive slots.8) Be creative:8a) Sell a battery pack that mounts in the SSD space.8b) Sell an M.2 mount breakout for the SSD space.8c) Sell a Qi charger that mounts in empty corner left of battery, south of SSD.",4

339,Acer,"Holy Moly This is...great.To be clear, it isn't a top 1% of all laptops laptop.There are some compromises made, especially out of the box, however once it's set up I find I can play pretty much everything with no trouble.And yes, that includes Oculus Rift S stuff (more on which in a moment).First, out of the box specs are, in my opinion, a bit lean in terms of RAM and storage space.Now while this may sound odd, keep in mind that gaming culture really does assume that the user is going to be adding and upgrading and modifying and all of that, so I mention this for informational purposes.First thing I did was increase RAM to 32 GB, and second thing was to add a 2 TB M.2 NVME drive.This does help things quite a bit.As an aside, for a purpose-built gaming laptop there sure are a LOT of screws holding the case together.That tells me this system design isn't like a Razer or Alienware that has maybe three screws holding the bottom cover on.This may be a small nit but it's still annoying.Anyway, I then spent about two hours getting rid of all the bloatware and updating the Windows 10 install.Then another hour or so installing various titles from my Steam library.Then I played.A lot.Simply put, this handled everything I threw at it.Zero problems with the Tomb Raider series at max settings.Arkham, yep.Bioshock, yep.And while I realize these are old(er) titles, they still have the potential to stress hardware at the highest settings, but no stress in this system.So already this is no compromise to my Dell G7.BUT, the 144 hZ screen has me playing supported games on the laptop itself and not through an external monitor.The screen colors and such are very good, brightness is good, and while it's not as immersive as a 30+ inch curved monitor it's certainly no slouch either.I LOVE the graphics card.True there aren't a ton of titles (yet) supporting ray tracing, but those that do look spectacular.Minecraft (yep, Minecraft) looks great here.And the system, once things are beefed up a bit via some work I did earlier, performs well under those expectations.Now then, all is not lollipops and rainbows here.We get into Oculus Rift S setup.On paper this system checks all the boxes for system requirements.BUT, it is missing a dedicated DisplayPort.Oh, I know what the specs say, but DisplayPort functionality here is handled via a Thunderbolt port.HOWEVER, that Thunderbolt port is NOT wired to the NVIDIA graphics card, so as far as Oculus is concerned it doesn't exist.After experimentation and many thrown items, I was able to get this system to work with the Oculus Rift S via a *powered* HDMI/DP adapter.I do have to ignore the little blurb on the Oculus software that says the system doesn't meet minimum requirements because, well, it's wrong.This system does work well with the Rift S and in fact performs better than my Dell G7.Battery life....hey, it's a gaming computer.Minimal at best.:)As for the extras, if you like red and black then this is your jam.No provision in this model to change keyboard lighting.Bummer yeah.I'll overlook it based on heat management, inasmuch as this does a good job of staying cool.I like the hard key that gets me into the fan control, rather than having to memorize a function key combination.And of course, the entire physical system profile is thin and light.Plastic dominates the construction of course, but it's made solid enough to handle a lot of carrying around.Only nit there is the plastic itself does tend to show fingerprints and smudges more than I thought it would.So.As a gaming laptop it does pretty much everything a non-professional gamer would expect.Upgrading and modding is hit or miss and I wish there weren't 1,186 screws holding the bottom cover on.The, well, disappointing wiring of the Thunderbolt port is very frustrating (honestly, is it that big of a deal to have it connect to the graphics card too, not just intel...?) and gave me a headache that could have been avoided.BUT, at the end of the day the system handles a lot.Sound, graphics, etc are great.True they may not impress the gamers who have endorsement deals, but then this isn't aimed at them.This is a laptop aimed at people like me, who want to enjoy gaming without it being their job.And at that, it succeeds brilliantly.",5

Definitely no complaints on the computer. It has a nice screen and mouse pad is very responsive..BUT TO OUR SURPRISE, WE GOT A BIG ISSUE within 24 hours of our son using the laptop!The left arrow key was continuously depressed and would not function correctly.Having a technical background, I tough it would be an easy fix.After spending about 2 hours, I still was not able to fix the keyboard reliably. (see picture)Even though Acer offered to have the laptop mailed in for repair, I took the laptop to a local computer repair shop and they were able to reseat the loose arrow key. 😊Immediatelly purchased a separate keyboard in order to avoid similar guture mishaps with the Acer laptop.Considering how quick the keyboard got issues,I CAN NOT RECOMMEND this laptop for giving it to an Game loving 8 year old, unless you get an additional keyboard to protect the delicate laptop keyboard.",2

I bought an acer computer based on amazon reviews and have had nothing but trouble. It gets caught in endless up date loops. (As in hours every time you turn on the computer). I removed all software and apps to try and help remediate. I even tried to use with only internet access on the computer. Again still gets caught in endless update. I will be buying a new computer (not acer) and will NEVER trust amazon Rating system again.,1

Anyone who has tried playing Sims 4 with that many expansions knows how amazing that is. I definitely recommend.,5

387,Acer,"Splotchy reliability, required a return to the service facility in the first 4 months of ownership It's a feature packed little convertible with lots of ports and power, but the GPU is a weak link in an otherwise strong chain. It's definitely not robust for serious gaming or graphics applications, but it was fine for watching movies while traveling and away from larger screen options.My device was glitchy right out of the box with freeze ups that maxed out the fans and prevented a reboot or a hard shutdown - had to insert a pin into the tiny reset hole on the back of the device to turn it off. I only used it a few hours a week and it didn't lock up all the time, but it occurred randomly more than a half dozen times during the first few months of ownership (often enough that I kept a pin handy) and the last one left the backlights on the keyboard inoperable. I paid about $25 to ship it to the service center under warranty to repair the backlit keyboard and they turned it around within two days with no explanation of what repairs were necessary. Time will tell if their keyboard fix also resolves the freeze up gremlins. If not, I'll caulk it up to receiving a lemon and request a replacement unit.When it was working, it did so very well - the touch screen spoiled me, but since it's Windows based and not Android, it was a little frustrating not being able to use the extensively customizable touch controls I'm accustomed to with my smartphone. Still, it's nice to have all the input options - onscreen keyboard, voice recognition, touch screen input and an external wireless keyboard and I'd hate to have to go back to a non-touch screen laptop.The convertible feature is nice to have, but the device is really too heavy to hold like a tablet for very long and it gets pretty hot too with the fans revving up and blowing the heat exhaust right on your hand in portrait mode. The power button is also inconveniently placed for landscape tablet mode since your hand falls right on it as you grip the sides of the device and I often inadvertently shut it down as a result. It works best as a traditional laptop for keyboard entry, a teepee display on a counter top or desk using touchscreen input or lying flat on a desk for pen and touch input.It obviously won't replace your desktop, gaming laptop or tablet, but it does provide a surprisingly powerful and small form factor alternative to those devices when something ""in between"" fits your needs. For the money, it's a really nice device and were it not for my particular unit's reliability issues (hopefully resolved), I'd have given it 5 stars.",3

Heck, I can barely safely turn the thing off without brute forcing ctrl alt delete.I suspect the weak link comes from this laptop housing merely 4gb of ram. I’m used to at least 8gb for laptops, but gave this one benefit of the doubt assuming modern technology would be more efficient with its usage. I’d bought a used asus a few years ago for the same price as this one with ram and an ssd twice the size as this one, so I’d like to know why customers are getting a worse product for the same price all this time later.If this thing starts to shine through more use I’ll edit this review, but for now, I’m severely disappointed and this is a terrible value for money.",1

437,Asus,"You get what you pay for. This item is a real piece of crap.Some of the worst speaker quality.If I have the speakers turned all of the way up, it still sounds muffled.It does not have the power to run some websites effectively.Don't expect good quality when streaming.When you turn the computer on it takes a long time to load the damn screen when you enter your login information.Or it just times out and you have to enter all of your information again and then wait another few minutes to load.I am really mad about this purchase so I want everyone to know that sometimes the product is cheap for a reason.Do not buy.",1

440,Asus,Nice full screen ; good apps; screen talks out loud Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This is a great computer for a affordable price & there are so many pre downloaded apps that are already installed! Would recommend to anyone that does music or plays games .,5
441,Asus,Works for Old School Runescape! If you’re wondering if this works for Old School Runescape and can run the game successfully without lag than yes. Yes it does I havnt fiddled with the settings yet but the screen produces a “matte” like look on the graphics.Would recommend buying,4
442,Asus,Wrong computer sent!!! I bought this computer but when I received it. It looks nothing like this.It has no name on the back lid. It does not rise at a angle when open. No fingerprint feature. No name on the screen frame. It has TUF engraved on the keypad. Its going to be headache to return it's no longer in the USA,1
443,Asus,"audio and hard disk drive problems Purchased this ASUS VivoBook 15 in April (3 months ago). Was disappointed when I did my first Zoom meeting as the speaker performed poorly to say the least. I have to use a bluetooth speaker each time I needed to listen.Today, sent the laptop back after a troubleshoot when I was unable to restart my computer. Turned out the hard disk drive was the problem.",3
444,Asus,"Go to another laptop if possible The quality of this laptop is nothing to write home about. When I first open my laptop it didn’t start up. So I thought maybe it the battery so I went to grab the charger but when I turned around it started turning on so I guess there a lag in start up time. Also, when I using it to type it not the most user friendly laptop to type papers with. Also going on the internet it look 30 seconds to even show the icon active. Overall I gave it a 2-star due to just the main reason it was reasonable price, but other than that nothing much more",2

447,Asus,Laptop is NOT backlit The computer is fine.I am disappointed that it is misrepresented as having a backlit keyboard.This feature was a key reason why I chose this particular laptop.I should have expressed this to Amazon customer service sooner however thought the feature was something I had to enable.Wrong.This feature is absent.Buyer beware...if a backlit keyboard is important don't purchase this laptop.,2
448,Asus,"Very pleased with this Windows laptop The features (display, cpu, RAM, SSD, HDMI, and BACKLIT KEYBOARD) came at a good price. Boots really fast and has a keyboard with a great touch.I'm an older user, so I added a USB-C dongle with an Ethernet port and a wireless mouse, but these are not needed, I just like them. I have been using it for two months with no hiccups. Both work stuff (Office Suite), and the personal stuff like surfing and streaming.I'm not a gamer, so I cannot comment on that application.I'm really happy with what Asus has put together. Would definitely recommend it for anything except gaming. If it got stolen, I would get another one provided the price was still competitive.",5

Cuando se usan los ventiladores se hacen notar.Buenas especificaciones y buen precio, aunque hay algunas cosas que no están del todo bien.un punto en contra es su ram, consideren ampliar a 16 por lo bajo, 8 no le saca provecho a la tarjeta de video.La batería tampoco dura lo que dice la página, es de mucho menos potencia.Fuera de eso, feliz con la compra.",5

467,Asus,"Good value.. but I bought this for a 2 week vacation trip to Costa Rica.I wanted something in place of my 13"" MBP that would be OK if it got lost, broken or stolen - I would be staying in inexpensive hotels, there are parts of CR that are a bit dodgy, it rains a lot this time of year where I was going.I was taking a carry-on only and keeping that in hand when transiting around so losing it wasn't too likely.The L410 was certainly OK and worth the price.But, I definitely missed my MBP.A couple criticisms of the L410:1. I VERY much rely on the back-lit keyboard on my MBP.The first thing I tried on the L410 was the back-lit keyboard.It worked fine.I then applied the numerous Windows updates, downloaded a couple apps (Geany, Filezilla, etc) and found that the back-lit keyboard had stopped working.I Googled it and couldn't find a fix (the most promising looking recommendation to download the ASUS System Control Interface driver was a dead end).I assume the software will get fixed eventually and it will start working again by itself, but the trip is over.2. The L410 speakers have been criticized multiple times here on Amazon Reviews, but they are even worse than I imagined.I am now watching movies on my MBP that I had watched on the trip and am hearing a lot I missed on the L410.If you think you'll be say, watching movies a lot, you might try bring headphones.The speakers were OK for a Zoom call though.3. I don't know if the keyboard layout is standard Windows, but the position of the Ctl and Fn keys on the left make it very difficult to use in one-handed key combinations.Also, I know I'm used to the shallow stroke of the keys on the MBP, but I much prefer their travel and clickiness.4. The trackpad is not bad.It is fairly responsive and accurate.It has quite a bit of downward play that takes some getting used to.I prefer the non-click-just-touch operation and it worked sort of OK - not great but most of the time.But Asus really needs to provide a way to disable the keypad overlay.It all-to-easily gets turned on (indicated by the LED in it's upper right corner).Then you don't notice it until the trackpad becomes unresponsive as a (mouse) pointer device.I tried deleting the driver for it but the driver returned (I guess in a save-the-user-from-himself Win10 process).I found a somewhat convoluted set of steps on how to disable it permanently, but Asus really needs to make it easier to disable.All in all, a good value at $260 but next trip, I'll probably risk it and bring the MBP.",4

469,Asus,"visual studio installs! while this review is otherwise early, i thought it worth noting that the process of upgrading from windows ""S"" security mode and installing visual studio, and an array of hardware and software development apps has gone smoothly. i was concerned about the processor meeting the minimum requirements since i had little understanding of these new variable ratings - the geekbench rating is about 16 times higher than my old toshiba ;)while i haven't made sufficient observation of processor speed beyond use during setup, i haven't found any frustration with the speed of these operations. tbh i'm pleasantly surprised to have installed some older 32 bit apps such as synthedit and ones i wrote with borland's 90's fclt compiler and see them run without prejudice.the overall size is close to my aged toshiba netbook, except that it's light and quiet and probably tougher with the SSD. the pixels are so small i can hardly discern between them.i'm sort of amazed after earlier perusals to be able to purchase a functional development platform for $210. the only drawback i've found is that the keys and the work surface are all black, and the letters are thin, you can't see the key layout when its dark, i understand people are used to fancy backlit keys, i'd just recommend a colour contrast.lovely thing.",5
470,Asus,"Excellent product at a great price This computer was a great purchase for my son. He likes to play Roblox, Minecraft and Steam games. This computer has the capability and speed to play these games and plenty of room to hold them. It is not a gaming computer but is capable of playing these games without too much lag time. The touchpad that moves the mouse icon does like to stop responding to touch but simply press the F6 key to toggle it back on and off and it will start working or plug in a mouse. The battery lasts an extremely long amount of time. The display is very clear and good quality. Excellent product for the price. The seller, Lucky Trading, has excellent customer service and was very helpful with communication and when I needed product support. Highly recommended.",5

Also handles games well. The downsides of this are the battery life. I get 2 hours give or take depending on the task, but I'm usually plugged in. It's worth the tradeoff of paying another $2k for a Macbook. Maybe check out some of the newer Acer models and compare specs depending on what you need to do.",4

There are major battery faults with this product, every time the charger gets plugged in or unplugged the entire screen goes black for 30 seconds! It takes way longer than a new laptop should to turn on. And it lagged and froze up even running just photoshop.

Less than Half the Cost.....but I wanted to downsize.This Laptop is AMAZING for gaming. I can play EVERY game that I was playing on the Alienware....only Faster.With High Detaile settings this performs BETTER than the Alienware. The CPU and Graphics card work as well if not better. No heat issues, although the fan can get a little noisey at times.....something I can live with. I do most of my gaming on my 60"" Flat Screen TV.....with normal sound settings, the fan dosn't bother. I've been playing a lot since getting this computer....and it Impresses Me Everytime I Play on It. Its so Slim and Light that I have a hard time believing that this can perform on this level. When I gave the Alienware to my son, I thought that my New gaming Laptop would be an obvious second place machine. This is not what I have discovered. This ASUS gaming laptop is in my mind, by far a superior gaming laptop. VERRY IMPRESSED, PLEASED, and SURPRISED.",5

494,Asus,"My first PC since windows 98 I’m coming from a mostly Mac stand point, as the last time I used windows, it ran 98.This is my favorite laptop/computer experience. The Vivobook is thin and light, and mine has been running silent, consistently. (A worry I had coming from Mac, which never made a peep, but I always heard PCs sounding like jets.)The screen size of 14 inches, I am finding to be my ideal. It’s not too bulky to be cumbersome on my lap, but it’s not too small to be inconvenient when spending long periods of time reading or typing.The backlit keyboard was another main feature for me, and one of the reasons I decided to go with this model. Its just bright enough on the second setting to aide with late night typing, while also not having any blur, or excessive light bleed.The keys are also pleasant to type on, and provide a lot of comfort for longer writing sessions.There is no number pad off to the side, it’s all top row. This was a selling point for me, but I know it’s not for others.The Ryzen 5 is snappy. My Vivobook turns on, scans my finger, and is running full tilt in a matter of seconds. It’s extremely impressive and quicker than my 2018 MacBook. Web browsing, and video streaming feels smooth and seamless.The only con I have are the viewing angles of the screen. It doesn’t take much of a tilt or slight turn to experience the screen almost completely washed out. It’s not a (huge) deal, but it makes any kind of partner work a bit inconvenient. That’s why I docked to 4 stars instead of 5.Over-all I am happy I switched to Windows, and ultimately this Vivobook. Save yourself some money, and go with this.",4
495,Asus,"Problem with RAM!!! The vivobook stylish and looks very decent. But only 5.95 GB of 8 GB RAM is actually available for use which makes the laptop very slow. Therefore, I retuned it.

Anyone purchasing this for photo editing should already have a decent colorimeter, though.Weirdly, my biggest complaint so far is that the keyboard has no indicator LED for NUM LOCK.

523,Asus,"Definitely recommend this laptop I’ve always wanted a gaming laptop, and I’m really glad I got this one.Only thing is the battery life could be a bit better, especially while playing Minecraft. I just keep it plugged in while doing so.Otherwise, the RAM is great! I have a bookbag perfect for transporting it wherever I go.",5
524,Asus,"Nice fast gaming laptop but battery not so much This laptop runs The Sims 4 and Phasmophobia really well. The fan does get really loud and the laptop does get pretty warm too. I did have trouble with Skyrim, FPS issue I have to figure out.Now the battery is not so great. It will not stay fully charged. Sometimes it says 99% plugged in or even right now it's at 92% plugged in. Also the fact that the battery is inside the laptop is a drawback to me.I think this laptop was made in 2019?? Oh well still runs better than my non-gaming dinosaur laptop lol.",5
525,Asus,"Finally got the computer... screen has lines in it... great... Your browser does not support HTML5 video. So I got my computer today and first thing I notice is lines on my screen. Great. Its broken. And I didn't buy a warranty since I was already paying more than my first intital purchase of this computer which was1059.99 after tax and shipping. Cute little prank after saying the arrival date was the 24th only to change the ""arriving"" to ""we'll send you an email when this item is back in stock"".... when there was 16 left at the time. It is in stock, you just don't want to sell it for 50 dollars less than it is now. But whatever. I cancel the first order, buy the new price, it arrives earlier than expected. Good. Only to find ITS DEFECTIVE!!! ..... I'm choosing not to return it because who knows when I'll get the new one and if that will be in new condition. And I can't pay any kind of shipping for such a heavy computer if that'll be a thing. The computer itself as it runs is good, just that pisses me off after what I went through just to GET the stupid computer...",4

I had to activate and format it myself. That was a red flag right there. With a hybrid drive, both the SSD and HDD should be set up and ready to go.Then, when I tried to save a 250 GB folder to my EMPTY 1 TB HDD, it said it needed 50 more GB of space to save the folder. So my 1TB drive thought it only had 200 GB of space left available. All diagnostics came back fine. I even tried formatting again. The whole thing is just defective. I reset Windows back to factory settings and am returning it tomorrow.",1

I did not think any other laptop could compare but this one is even better. I love everything about it. I did not order a model with a touch screen so I am not rating that portion of the review.,5

No matter the tilt it was always sharp and clear. On this one you have to find the sweet spot. Tilt it too far toward you and it's washed out, too far back and it's too dark. Not the best for editing photos. I will give it credit for having more sturdy hinges than my ASUS, which is the main reason I chose it.",4
569,Dell,"NOT AS ADVERTISED! READ THE FINE PRINT The product description of this computer says the human interface includes a touch screen. It does not! It is only when you scroll down to the bottom of the page that you see it described as having a back lit non touch display. I have bought many computers through Amazon, but this may be the last one.

590,Dell,"Fast/Stable Very nice, very plain.An optical drive is nice to have becoming rare. Plenty of storage. Would purchase again, the wife loves it.",4
591,Dell,"Buyer beware Product came packed well. Fast shipping. However it said 1 TB PCle SSD plus 2TB HDD but really it was 931 GB and a little under 2 TB on the additional drive. So far computer runs well but I have only had it 2 days. It is much quicker then my old lap top. it is quiet not loud. I was surprised it had a CD drive I was not expecting that so that is good if you are using a CD drive.I will update my review after having it for awhile.The only annoying thing so far is that it sometimes does this flick thing not always just sometimes I am not sure what that is about.*******UPDATE*******12/5/20I have had and been using the laptop with no issues for a little over a month. Let me just start with the Dell laptop itself is great I didn’t really have any issues other then the occasional flicker.A few days ago I accidentally dropped it and it broke something inside the charging port. Everything else on the laptop is fine. This is where the issues come in. I know the warrantydoes not cover this it was my fault, however Dell would take it back and check it and let me know how much to repair it for me. However because it is registered in the company that I purchased it from on amazon IPuzzle they will not allow me to send it back. So after SEVERAL messages sent requesting that transfer of ownership for Dell be sent in my name I am left with a very bad taste from this company. This is my first time buying a Dell but not my first time buying a laptop on amazon. If I would have a do over I would NOT purchase from this company. I have been very upset with the entire situation. So as of right now I can’t use the laptop the company gives vague responses will not contact me so we can talk and Dell will not look at the laptop since it is not registered to me and is in a LOCKED status.",1
592,Dell,Good choice Super fast and sleek.. as promised!,5
593,Dell,"Fast. I have only used it a little bit, since it was a gift for our pastor.From what I've seen, it is very fast and it seems to handle internet browsing well.My pastor is using this computer to record podcast-type recordings from a USB microphone, and there's where the problem is.It isn't cooperating consistently enough to give a 5-star rating.It requires tweaking, so I'm not sure what the whole issue is.",4
594,Dell,"Great perosnal laptop for multitasking, VMs, etc. I got this laptop for three reasons-- the 32 GB of RAM and the 1TB Solid State Hard Drive (SSHD). The third reason is the price. You won't find any laptop shipping with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSHDanywhere under $2,000. I work in cybersecurity, so I wanted a personal laptop that could multi-task effectively-- e.g. run Splunk and different VMs be able to read/write data quickly. This laptop highly serves that purpose.It is a little slow out of the box i.e. you will need to do all the Windows/firmware/Dell updates, and strip out all the unnecessary programs. But once up and running and properly configured, it does a great job multitasking and as serve the exact purpose I wanted it to. The touch screen is nice too. It isn't UHD, it is FHD, but for my purposes, that doesn't even matter.32 GB of RAM and 1TB SSHD for under $1,000 can't be beat. If you are looking for a gaming laptop or something to deliver high graphics, this is not what you want. If you're looking for a great perosnal multitasking laptop that has a lot of RAM and fast data read/write access (i.e. you work in cybersecurity or are learning programming), something you can practice on effectively and run VMs in and still concurrently run Windows programs, this can't be beat for the price.",5
595,Dell,Love it Great. Love it. Should have gotten a bigger screen though.,5
596,Dell,My Dell Upon arrival I was a little intimated with the new computer and new software.Its now been a couple months since I got it and am loving it.Way to go DELL! Thanks!,5
597,Dell,"Dell premier line at its finest... Arriving inside a classic Dell box (we all know the look), inside is a very elegant presentation in a nice black box that is magnatized and opens up to reveal the Dell XPS 9710. Inside, you get the laptop, USB-C power adapter, power cord and a neat little Dell branded dongle along with some instructions. Minimalist in the best way.Once you take an initial look at this beautiful laptop, you quickly realize this is clearly Dell's answer to Apple's 16"" Macbook Pro in the BEST way possible.It has a very high build quality. The backlit keyboard, which eschews the number pad, is perfectly centered with decent speakers on each side. Like Apple, the trackpad is extremely oversized and responds to both taps and clicks along with various gestures. The display is 3840x2400 vs the standard 3840x2160 to even match the Mac's 16:10 ratio versus others 16:9. It even mimics the dual thunderbolt ports on each side and is powered by a compact(ish) USB-C power brick. Dell includes an adorable little dongle that has a single USB-A port and HDMI out, but of course the beauty of standard Thunderbolt ports is you can dongle your way to just about any type of connectivity you desire.Weighing in at ~5lbs 7oz, it is deceptively solid and depending on what you're used to using, it will feel slightly heavier or lighter. I normally use large laptops that use desktop processors or massive gaming laptops so I'm used to heaving around 11lb+ units with 3-4lb power supplies so this solidly built laptop feels relatively light. On the other hand, I have a few 15.6"" and 14"" Acers that are well under 5lbs, so compared to those it feels a touch heavy. Still, with everything included weighing a total of 6lbs 7oz, it is very manageable to move around and use.Powered by an Intel i7-11800h 11th gen 10nm processor, this is the optimal selection for this laptop. Do not feel any remorse for skipping the i9-11900h or i9-11980hk as all three are 8 core, 16 thread CPUs and thermal constraints will effectively make them all equal as they each run up against the inherent system power and thermal limits even with the advanced vapor chamber cooling Dell has implemented. Save yourself a very large chunk of money and pick the i7-11800h as it will perform effectively the same as the other two, pricier options.The 512GB M.2 NVMe is very speedy with another M.2 bay open and powered by dual channel 3200 16GB (2x8GB) memory, you are good to go right out of the box for your Windows 10 Pro needs. Luckily, the memory and storage are fully upgradeable so you can adjust it to your requirements.First time starting up you're met with all the standard setup options to get you up and running. This is a great and easy way to auto register your system with Dell for their award winning warranty service. The first thing you will want to do is a full Windows Update as the sheer amount of updates is massive including a large array of BIOS and FIRMWARE updates that will fix a few fan issues among other things. Dell works closely with Microsoft and Intel and it shows as the bulk of the drivers, even specialized ones, are immediately available for update and install making keeping your system up to date very easy.Depending on what you're using, performance is a mixed bag as the fans are slow to respond and the unit will thermal throttle....quickly. Testing with Cinebench 23, it is a race between getting the cooling up to full speed before the system throttles down permanently to its stock 45w rating. The CPU will initially even want to pull 90w+. Elevating the rear of the unit helps greatly to keep the throttle down to 45w from happening but it will still eventually settle in around 75w and continually bounce off the thermal limits routinely hitting 100 and throttling down. I was able to achieve a max score of 12600 multi and 1522 single which is just amazing for such a light, thin laptop. Even single threaded tests had individual cores hitting in the 90's which is concerning but it did not thermal throttle on single threaded tests so that is a plus. The fans are definitely there when under load but I've heard much louder from much lesser systems. Via the BIOS or Dell software, you can pick custom profiles to adjust for cool, quiet or ultra performance. But keeping everything in perspective, the overall performance was great and more than acceptable.The 3840x1200 16:10 display is absolutely gorgeous....gobsmackingly so and you can see it is the centerpiece of this high end laptop. 17.3"" with insanely bright ratings for a laptop panel (500 nit) and Dolby Vision HDR support along with full 100% sRGB and 100% Adobe coverage, it is a joy to view. Minimal back light bleed and zero bad pixels was the icing on the display cake. Colors are amazing and it is very responsive for desktop use. It absolutely trounces all my current and previous laptop panels. If you are looking for a top notch screen, this is it.I found the keyboard to be more than passable and the backlit functionality is great with a very classic Dell look. The very spacious trackpad is great. Solid to the touch and very responsive. I had no problems whipping all around the screen and using a few gestures for added functionality. Tapping and solid clicks both worked great. If you happen to end up with a bad touchpad as some have reported, reach out to Dell's warranty services and they will take care of it. Having used Dell Warranty Services numerous times over the past 10-15 years, their service and support is top notch.The Nvidia RTX 3050 4GB video is an odd choice. It is woefully underpowered to drive the native resolution of 3840x2400 for gaming unless you really dial down the settings. If you opt to run games at 1920x1200 (1:2 ratio), they run much better with a decent level of eye candy on. The panel is only 60hz but that makes sense with this level of GPU option. Basically, it is good enough that if you want to get some gaming done you definitely can but compromises and sacrifices will need to be made to achieve decent framerates to keep it at or around 60fps depending on your games played. It scored ~9000 in Superposition which is right in line with other 3050 scores. There are other models with a 3060, but in the end this is not a ""gaming laptop"" but an elegant productivity laptop that can also game if desired....you know....like the Macbook Pros.The webcam could be better but it gets the job done. This seems to be the issue with most laptops even to this day. Wireless is powered by Killer's 1650 and is fast and speedy and adheres to new WiFi 6e standards which is a plus.Overall, I am very pleased with the XPS 9710. I LOVE the screen. The backlit keyboard is great. The trackpad is massive and great to use. Performance is more than adequate and the i7-11800h paired with 16gb of dual channel 3200 memory and a very speed 512GB drive is the perfect sweet spot while keeping costs reasonable for this caliber of laptop. The 3050 will allow you to get some gaming in while having access to Nvidia's full array of 3000 series perks and the 4x Thunderbolt ports really let you dongle your system ""your way."" It is the perfect blend of a full size 17.3"" laptop with a decent weight profile, performance and good battery life to not only become your next laptop but also your only computer you will possibly need.I like it so much that this will be replacing my Acers and former Clevo as my new daily driver and main laptop I like it that much.5/5",5
598,Dell,"Dell XPS 17 9710: Beauty and Beast in a portable 17 inch laptop. The Dell XPS 17 9710 is a sleek productivity laptop, that looks good and feel fantastic.The 4k anti-reflective 500-Nit touchscreen is beautiful and bright with excellent color accuracy. It reached 100% sRGB, 100% aRGB, 100% NTSC and 96% DCI-P3.The display calibration was juts fine out of the box and calibrating just helps withThe laptop is build into an aluminum chassis (common in the XPS line), with a carbon fiber trackpad.The trackpad is very good, one of the best on a Windows laptop, but it is uneven by a hair. If you are keen to details, and at this price you should be, you will notice that it does requires a longer press and travel on the right side than the left.The keyboard is comfortable to type and the keys have a nice travel. I like the lack on numpad, which gives space for larger speakers and better sound.The power button has an integrated fingerprint reader, which makes a faster signing into Windows.There are 4 Thunderbolt 4 USB C ports (two on each side), headphone jack and a SD card reader. There is an USB C adapter include with an USB A and HDMI port, since the laptop has neither.If you transfer data from SD cards, you will like the speed, since transferring gigabytes of files takes just seconds.There is a Windows Hello 720 webcam. Most laptops webcams are disappointing and the 720p webcam here is not exception. I see a lot of folks complaining about laptop webcams quality when filming with huge expensive cameras.We want slim laptops but good quality webcams and that's not going to happen anytime soon. That is why even smartphones require a bump to be able to fit better quality cameras.Included a 130W AC to USB C charging adapter. I have several USB C power adapters and I was able to charge the laptop without problems. My USB C adapters are 3x smaller, which make them a better option to travel.The laptop comes with a huge 97Wh battery, that could last the whole day (8h) for web browsing and light tasks...if you disable the dedicated graphics card and tune down brightness below 50%.But it could last just a couple of hours depending of the workload.If you leave on its default setting, it uses Optimus to decided the best power usage.It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge the battery with the included 130W USB C power adapter.The Intel Core i7-11800H churns to every task like a champ.There are two NVMe M.2 slots in case you want to use multimedia content right on the laptop, or just want to have your entire app or game collection on your laptop.The 512GB Micron 2300 NVMe SSD reach above 3100 read and 2600 MB/s writes speeds while transferring data and it got better marks on CrystalDiskMark speed bench.The 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM is upgradable, so if your work requires more RAM, just remove the bottom cover and have at it. I do praise Dell for allowing us, end users, the option to expand the memory on the Dell XPS 17 9710 so it will have a longer life.There is a Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 (2x2) and Bluetooth 5.1. The Wi-Fi 6 might allow us to finally ditch the Ethernet cable. I was able to get 856 Mbit/s download speeds.The sound is quit nice for a laptop. Dell SPX 17 includes a quad speakers setting with a couple firing up on each side of the keyboard and two more firing down on each side of the trackpad (right next to the battery).The Dell XPS 17 9710 is a great laptop for content creation and it does a bit of gaming as well.The cooling chamber system does a very good job keeping the Core i7-11800H and the RTX 3050 churning along without missing a bit.The fan wasn't loud when light gaming or light multimedia tasks (31 dB) but it ramps up (49dB) on heavy workloads when the CPU and GPU are taxed.The palmrest gets a bit warm and it gets pretty toasty around the firs row of the keyboard.Besides the trackpad right corner issue, I have not found anything else to complain about the Dell XPS 17. By the way, this should not be happening on Dell's top of the line laptop and quality control (QC) should be better.I would have like a better webcam and the option of a dark grey color, instead of silver.Benchmarks and scoresHandBrake: 7 min: 48 secs (convert 12 min: 13 sec 4K video (Tears of Steal) to 1080P MP4CrystalDiskMark: 3237.65 MB/s read 2876.37 writeGeekbench 5: 1531 single-core / 7796 multi-core / 60706 CUDABlender bmw27: 4m 3sBlender classroom: 11m 24sBlender Barcelona: 11m 46sCinebench r23: 10360 pts multi-core / 1512 pts single-coreCinebench 20: 4199 pts multi-core / 578 pts single-coreUnigine Valley: FPS 126.2 / score 5279 (1080p high setting)Unigine Valley: FPS 32.5 / score 1359 (4k high setting)PCMARK 10: 6006 / Essentials 9227 / Productivity 8498 / Digital Content Creation 74983DMARK Time Spy: 54213DMARK Fire Strike: 112393DMARK Night Raid: 20279LatencyMon: No latency issues video playback at 60 FPS smooth without dropped frames.",5
599,Dell,"This laptop is a dream to use. It’s quick, stylish, and runs cool. Dell XPS 17 9710, 17 inch UHD+ Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Core i7-11800H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 4GB GDDR6, Windows 10 Pro - Platinum Silver (Latest Model)The laptop arrives in an understated black cardboard box. The only thing on the outside of the box is the Dell logo and the spec list of the laptop. Opening the box, right inside the first flap is a sticker advising you that if you need any help with setup to visit Dell support.Inside the plain cardboard box is a much fancier box! This is a presentation worthy box that is in a dull gloss black finish and has the Dell logo in the middle. The opening flap is a magnetic clasp, and when you open the lid embossed in the middle of the top of the lid are the letters XPS, pressed in stylish silver text. Right on top, is the XPS laptop itself, its brilliant silver case exterior enclosed in a plastic cell stain envelope to keep everything nice and pretty and shipping. Picking the laptop out of the box and removing the cellophane, the laptop has some weight to it. Physically, it weighs a little over five pounds, but it just feels weighty in your hand. The very base of the laptop is molded plastic with rubber feet, but the top is a brushed metal, stainless steel? In the box, underneath where the laptop was stored is the accessories that come with this, It has the USB-C power supply and it's attending AC cord, a USB-C to HDMI adapter, and a classy folded black envelope containing simple instructions for where all the switches and pickups are on the laptop, the warranty and safety information, and the governmental regulator regulatory information sheet.As much as I want to dive right in and play with the new laptop, I'm going to plug it in to charge first, as they rarely come with a full charge. I'm certain that once I fire it up, there will be updates in such to run. No matter how brand spanking new a computer is, there will always be updates that have come out since it was manufactured.This laptop is equipped with four USB-C ports, two on each side, and any of the four will allow you to charge the unit. When you plug the power supply into your wall socket, the USB-C power and that goes into the laptop has a small glowing white LED light that shows you it has power.Turning the computer on for the first time, there is no obvious power button. The power button and the fingerprint reader are one and the same, the key in the extreme upper right-hand corner of the board. There's no writing on it because the key is the fingerprint reader. I'm guessing you can't put any writing on it or else it will interfere with the reading. The computer started up in the middle of setting up windows for the first time. It seemed strange to me the first couple of times I saw this on a new laptop, but it appears that's the way all of them start. That way you're getting a fresh install of a nice clean windows copy.My first impression, typing on the keyboard to put in the information to set up windows, is that the keystrokes seem sure and while they don't have an audible click, it does have a definite feel to it when you have struck the key. The backlighting on the keys is bright enough to see them easily in dim lighting. Installation goes pretty fast on this machine, to me that is a preview of how well it'll perform later. On a side note, setting up windows using your Microsoft profile greatly speeds setup time and security. Microsoft has a Windows authenticator app that you can install on your phone to verify that it is you that is setting up the machine. I use this myself because it's one less complicated password I need to remember.For logging on to this laptop, you have multiple choices. You can use Windows Hello, which reads your face, or you can use your fingerprint. I'm setting it up with Windows hello for the moment and will add my fingerprint later. You can also connect your smartphone to the computer, so you won't miss any messages or texts - when activated any texts you get will show up as a pop-up.This laptop also comes with a free trial of Microsoft 365, but only a month - so to be honest, I'm not going to mess with it.McAfee antivirus is also bundled with this laptop, but I'm choosing not to activate it at this time, and rely on Windows defender. I have felt in the past, that McAfee was very intrusive, and on some of my older PCs, actually slowed them down. I'm sure it wouldn't slow down this powerhouse, but I don't care for their interface anyway so I'm not turning it on at this time. If I change my mind, I can always activate it later.The final setup bits of programming went by very fast with this machine, I would have to say that full setup starting from first turning it on to being completely logged in and seeing the desktop was around 20 minutes, give or take. This time included me looking over the laptop and discovering all the physical features as well.Once you start using the laptop and opening programs, my Dell will automatically launch and prompt you to set up the warranty activation and expedited diagnostics that are included with the package. It also includes critical product updates when needed.Once you register the unit, it takes you to the My Dell app that gives you all kinds of details about your machine. Checks your warranty status, gives you system details and access to device manuals as well as adjusting settings. You can also integrate Alexa with this as well should you desire.After I set up a PC or laptop, one of the first things I do is check for updates. Since Dell has a lot of consumer-friendly programs preloaded on this, I'm going to try their Dell update and see what it shows in need of upgrades. It did indeed find several updates, including critical updates, security updates, component hardware updates, and indeed an update to the "" Dell update "" program itself.Doing all of the initial updates may take a while, so don't be surprised if it does. Once the Dell update program finishes, you'll want to restart your laptop and then run it again. Then repeat, until it says there are no more updates. On one of my update cycles, there was a warning to connect power and do not disconnect it while the update was in process because it was updating the firmware as well. So, evidently, the Dell update program will also update the BIOS automatically. That's a pretty good feature because updating the BIOS manually can be pretty difficult if you don't do it precisely correctly. The firmware updates take a while because it seems that it's updating multiple components in the system. During all these updates, it took a while for it to get hat enough to need the fans to run, but once they kicked in, they were pretty quiet.So far, this laptop is a dream to use. It’s quick, stylish, and runs cool. If I run into any problems with this, I will update this review as needed.",5
600,Dell,Works great Very fast and has pretty much all the bells and whistles.Highly suggest purchasing.,5
601,Dell,"Sevaral issues Reloading a Generic window is not a straight forward process.Upgrading to two drives is nearly impossible. I will post a picture.Laptop runs hot.Intake is underneath, exhaust is on top, toward the screen.(117F/47C on top)I do not know who designed this, but really?Two stars is due to the near impossibility to upgrade this laptop with a second drive.The cooling system is poorly designed.Other than that, if you do not care about a second drive, this laptop is great despite running a bit hot.",2

603,Dell,"Work laptop- definitely worth the purchase! I bought this as a work computer and it’s lived up to the features. It runs smoothly, it has a big screen and has pretty much all the functions I’d need fora work laptop. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone.",5

610,Dell,"So far, All good Preliminary....This laptop is small & very light.",5
611,Dell,Meets all my expectations. A very fast computer. I do genealogy research. I like everything about this computer except the backlit keyboard. There are times when the lighting in the room interferes with the lt keyboard and the letters on the keyboard disappear. I am sorry I am not that good of a typist. I need to see the letters on each key while I am typing. So I have turned off the keyboard lighting. I feel the reason could be that the keys are the same color as the face of the computer (silver). Maybe if the keys were black this might help. Also if the letters were bolder type more light would show through.,5
612,Dell,"Great value computer Great computer, fast start up, light, bright screen.",5

617,Dell,"Very satisfied Bought laptop back in August 2020. Very happy with the clean and fully functional laptop that we received. System was cleaned and prepared for new owner.

Pero prefiero recuperar algo y no les recomiendo con mi experiencia comprar un equipo reutilizado. Por lo menos con este proveedor. En caso primera y última vez.",1
619,Dell,"Good deal, except... Works great, I would buy it again (I would get the warranty next time).But after 4 months all of a sudden the battery stopped taking a charge.

The seller upgrades lower spec laptops and sells them as they are high grade Dell OEM laptops. These upgrades are NOT from the factory as is clear if you go online and check the service tag.The way they cover the specs of the box with a white sticker that it shouldn't be noticed, it is obvious that they're trying to hide something. When you start the laptop you will see that they did upgrade it... Is this what you had in mind??",1
636,Dell,Battery life is amazing I love it so far. The battery life is much better than the Lenovo I had before and the screen resolution is amazing. It has the backlit keyboard and the keys are dark which facilitates when you type.,5

It's lightening quick, the build quality is great and it's sleek. Performance is mind blowing as well and the finger print scanner works well. My only beef is that the lighted keyboard could have been brighter. The keys are silver and the lighting is a white light - so it's difficult to see. I actually see the keys between when I disable the keyboard light. Overall, a really nice purchase !",5

Although it's only has four gigabytes of RAM it isn't working as slowly as I expected, possibly because I'm only using it for productivity purposes.I think it would be the perfect laptop if you're only using it for the productivity tools, online work and not anything extensive like online gaming. It has a long battery life about 10 hours more or less, the display is okay not very high quality and the camera quality is poor but it gets the job done.I think it's one of my best purchases yet though and i hope it lasts throughout college.",5

And still, I seem to struggle to navigate large PDFs.If you happen to try the keyboard out and fall in love like I did I would recommend getting this model. However, spring for the most RAM you can afford. I regret not getting the 16GB. I guess word processing is the new 4K video streaming. :(BTW this is after deleting bloat ware (I don’t have an Xbox or want to date Cortana), making sure it is fully updated, and using storage sparingly.Battery life: B-Screen: B+Solid but probably won’t last me the handful of years until graduation.

The diagnosis was that the motherboard needed to be replaced, the repair place told me it would cost around $500 to repair and suggested I reach out to Lenovo. The local repair shop also mentioned that this was a common problem with this specific laptop. I called Lenovo and they said my warranty had expired and there was nothing they could do for me. I got 14 months out of a $650 computer. Don't waste your money! You've been warned.",1
703,Lenovo,Great for the granddaughter. It is what I hoped for in a laptop/tablet. Like it and the granddaughter likes it for her school work.,5

707,Lenovo,"Unintelligible Sound Quality on Zoom I was excited to find a mid- range laptop with a touch screen and ability to use like a tablet.I don't do much that requires a lot of computer power and Zoom is probably the most demanding thing I do.The first one I received had sound issues on Zoom ( echoes, pinging sounding underwater) that were so bad I could not be understood.Thinking this was a defective laptop, I asked for a replacement.The replacement has the same issue!So it's a design problem.I did not have this problem on Microsoft teams but I mostly use Zoom and I think any new laptop should be configured to work well on this popular platform for virtual meetings.My 9 year old laptop works well on zoom.So this one is being returned and I'll look for another good deal on a different laptop.",2
708,Lenovo,"This Item Does NOT Have a Manufacturer's Warranty, Buyer Beware Delivered April 29th, it sat in a box until three days ago when my wife was getting it set up for school.It had been opened one time before that to turn it on and see if it worked, and then plugged in to charge.Today she opened it up and the screen literally fell out of the housing and cracked.I have no idea what type of failure happened in QA or manufacturing to cause this but this laptop had been touched literally three times prior to breaking.It had not left the house, it hadn't been dropped, mishandled, bumped into, or anything else that would cause damage such as it currently has.As it is outside the return window for Amazon we had to contact customer support at Lenovo who promptly told us that this item is not covered for hardware under the manufacturer's warranty, only software was covered.The only way to remedy this situation is for us to pay to ship it to Lenovo, pay to have them fix it, and pay to ship it back.Cross shipping was not offered to us, my wife starts school next Monday and we have no laptop for her now because of this absolute nonsense.Never again Lenovo, not a cent from my family or friends.I've dealt with some shady garbage from vendors before but this honestly takes the cake for generating sheer outrage.In summary, do not buy this product or any other from Lenovo unless you buy it with a credit card and can charge back if required, or it comes from Costco where they'll eat crap so you don't have to.",1
709,Lenovo,"Battery problem the first 6 months. Fan died in a little over a year Do NOT buy this product, it is disposable. Nice features but it breaks in no time. 5 months after I bought it I had to replace the battery.

710,Lenovo,Good performance Good performance,5
711,Lenovo,"Fantastic Seller I received this item in July so this is a later review. For electronics I always like to wait at least a month to see how they fare.Well this one has done above and beyond my expectations. Everything is exceptional.The touch screen is sensitive to the pen but just sensitive enough with finger touch thatit recognizes if you're purposefully using touch or if it was an accident.Screen quality is gorgeous for the price! I play around with astronomy and other types of things that require high resolution and I have no problem with the quality this laptop provides.Battery life is surprisingly longer than I expected it to be....I may not do much gaming but I do a lot of blender, etc. And I get a good 4-6 hours when pushing it to render etc. On average I'd say it could definitely handle at minimum 6-8 if doing light tasks etc.The seller reached out to me before I even received the shipment to make sure I knew they were available and willing to help with any questions, concerns, or if there had been any damage during shipment. They reached out once again after I received the shipment to make sure I received it and repeat what they said before....I am 100% grateful that the seller was so thoughtful in this manner, and apologize, if you're reading this, for not responding. I meant to respond to your amazon messages but always had something come up, and then I'd lose the information as I have it set in my inbox to delete after reading.Tl;DrGreat Seller, great product, sensitive but not too sensitive touch screen, nice battery life 4-6 with hard work and 6-8 with small tasks. Will definitely buy from seller again!Will post photos at another time...also they sell screen guards for this..and I highly recommend them!",5
712,Lenovo,"A long search brought me to this one Much more affordable than many that I looked at with comparable specs. It works really well. It’s fast and the screen size, and keyboard, are everything that I needed.",5
713,Lenovo,It's everything you want but no student discount Great for that price range but I hope it came with a student discount,5

715,Lenovo,"I would recommend this pc. I do not use the touch screen or camera.First thing I did was have it removed from ""S"" mode.microsoft displays a lot of gall with that.I pretty much only use this for e-mail and surfing the net.This pc seems to work perfectly for that purpose.This is my first laptop.I used desktop's before.I am having a little trouble adapting to the smaller keyboard.The i3 processor is plenty for my purposes.All in all, it is functioning perfectly.I don't move it around much.So, I dont test how sturdy it is.I am quite happy with my purchase.I would recommend.",4
716,Lenovo,Great for office or student laptop Works well for the office. No complains. Does the job efficiently. Nothing fancy,5
717,Lenovo,Todo bien Todo bien,5
718,Lenovo,Very good for schooling Bought this laptop for my wife to be for her studies and it had been working very effectively for this purpose....,5
719,Lenovo,Light and capable I like it.Have used or worked on many laptops over the years.This one is very light weight and is plenty fast for what I'm doing.The full HD screen is great and really beats the 720p screens on other ideapad 3's.Seen lots of comments about a dim screen.Just go to display properties and turn up the brightness.By default it's set about half way.It will serve its purpose!,5
720,Lenovo,"its fine. its just OK. its like a laptop from 2005. This laptop is an 'upgraded' stock version of another, with more disk space and ram or whatever, but everything else is stock.My biggest gripes are the screen and speakers. The screen, while 1920x1080, is not very bright. Nighttime viewing is fine, but anything in the daytime requires enough shade to actually see the screen. The viewing angle for an LCD is also pretty small, was expecting it to be better.The speakers are really crap. Like using a cell phone from 2008. Dolby audio? Sure, maybe, if the speakers were larger than 1 inch and not set underneath the keyboard, its all muffled and sounds awful.Windows runs OK on this machine, with the 20gb of ram I got its pretty good, but I still have massive issues doing normal things. Wifi connectivity is bad, and sometimes crashes when trying to connect. windows explorer crashes often when just trying to look at files, even with an empty hard drive on a new PC.Windows also forces you to have an account with them to login, and I am not able to turn off the login password.All in all, im returning this laptop.",2
721,Lenovo,Does not have cd rom drive Its a little small,5
722,Lenovo,Not too happy when typing The keys tend to stick when typing.Especially the enter key and space bar.,2
723,Lenovo,"More than adequate laptop! I just received this laptop a few days ago. It took me about 15 minutes to set up. I installed Norton 360 and MS Office 365 with no issues. As you can see from the pics, the dimension are close to my Mac Air with the Idea Pad being a little bulkier. The screen resolution is better than average, and the machine incredibly fast at 20GB RAM / 1TB SSD using the Ryzen 3 processor.. Additionally, it is very well made, and If I could change one thing, it would be to have a USB port on the right side for a mouse. Although a wireless works just fine on the left side. My overall take on this laptop; it is an incredible value for the money. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase.",5
724,Lenovo,Couldn’t even handle driver updates I tried updating the drivers and the screen broke on the second day of using it. Not sure if it was a Radeon issue or a hardware failure with the display but the screen would pixilate every so often during its short lifespan. Support was not very helpful. Ended up going with an Asus instead 👌,1
725,Lenovo,Worth the money Really happy with my laptop. Battery life is awesome and touch screen is great.,5
726,Lenovo,"Love, love, love As you can tell, I love this computer. It's fast, love the light up keyboard, and everything else!!",5
727,Lenovo,Came with features advertised! So far.....love it!,5
728,Lenovo,Really good! I really loved the laptop! It works amazingly just as i imagined. I think it would be really useful for my school work and to watch shows and movies. I gave it 4 stars because the shipping took a bit longer to arrive than what it said. But either wah its still an awesome laptop!!!!,4
729,Lenovo,A fast laptop This is a greatlaptop that comes configured as a business laptop. It is thin and fairly light plus has acceptable battery life running office applications at a lowered screen brightness. The main draw back is the screen brightness which automatically dims to 80% when running on battery power. This is not a laptop for outdoor use. The build quality isgreat and the 4700u processor is fast and runs pretty cool. I'm not disappointment with the purchase and expect this laptop to be around for some time.,4
730,Lenovo,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER. I returned the item within one week of purchasing as it ended up not being the laptop for me. I repackaged everything perfectly and followed all instructions and they charged us $350.00. They are a scam!,1
731,Lenovo,Great value. Very fast access to files and pictures. Nice light thin case.,5
732,Lenovo,"I loooove this laptop This is the perfect budget laptop if you're a student or just working from home. (I use it for youtube, teams, zoom, writing documents and just browsing). The size is very nice and the keyboard is soft. The touch screen is a nice touch too. The camera is not SUPER high quality but works just fine for videocalls. The only thing about this laptop I would improve is the battery since it goes out a bit fast.",5
733,Lenovo,"Muy buen equipo y cumplió con las expectativas esperadasl La velocidad del puntero en la pantalla tactil es rápido, con respecto a la bateria es larga y duradera con forme al uso que se le de, al momento de captar la señal de igual forma es rápido y lee la señal de Internet 5G y tiene una cámara de buena calidad.",5
734,Lenovo,Great Great,5
735,Lenovo,DOA wouldn't charge Item was DOA and would not charge. Tried to get a replacement but they would only refund my purchase price and would have to buy again but now it's not on sale anymore so I would end up paying more than $100 extra.,1
736,Lenovo,"Sharp, fast laptop The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15 15.6"" laptop is a perfect PC for my needs. I use the computer for simple daily tasks such as emails, calendars, spreadsheets, word processing, and internet services. This device is a huge upgrade from my older laptop. It was easy to set-up, although I had to reboot the computer as it froze during initial startup/update for Windows 10, which made me nervous. However, it restarted quickly and it seems like everything updated just fine and then finished the set-up quickly. The screen is very sharp and large for a laptop and the keyboard has a full numeric keypad which is a great feature.There are plenty of input ports for external dvd drive, monitors, wireless mouse w/USB receiver, power, etc., which is a positive. The biggest issue I have with this is the battery life is short- a fully charged battery will only last around 4 hours running low power programs which is pretty bad for today’s battery life standards. Fortunately I use this device mostly at home where it will be plugged-in, but if I had to travel, I’d have to constantly be looking for a charging station. Overall, I am enjoying the new computer and would recommend it as long as you aren’t constantly using the battery for power.",4
737,Lenovo,"Looks Good for Gaming, Is Excellent for Remote Engineering Work I don't do any gaming-- so I can't speak to specifics there. However, between the hardware, built in software for running macros, 8Gb DDR4 RAM and the SSD-- this seems like it's be a good contender for a lot of todays games. Obviously it has wifi built in, but it also has an Ethernet jack as well.What I can comment on as an engineer that works from home (thanks COVID!), this is an excellent work laptop. I've got a lot to comment on, so let me bullet point it:-8GB RAM is great for AutoCAD and other memory intensive applications-A numberpad is absolutely awesome when you're working in spreadsheets half the day (the inclusion of the numberpad does scrunch the rest of the keyboard a bit, but it is worth it)-15"" is about the limit of what I think is easy to stash in a backpack and go-Built in Ethernet jack means I don't have to worry about my wifi dropping out during calls or in the middle of working on big projects-HDMI out for hooking up another monitor-USB-C for hooking up a more modern USB hub to expand the available ports, etc-Fast processor doesn't bog down when running heavy applications-Built in webcam for Zoom calls (though this is pretty standard these days)-SSD for lightning quick start up timesMy only complaints about this laptop are relatively minor:-Keyboard keys feel like laptop keys. There's not getting around that, they are low profile with minimal movement compared to a dedicated keyboard. But that's true of almost all laptops-Keyboard is a bit smaller than a dedicated keyboard, but that's to be expected and acceptable to me as I love having a numberpad built in-Hard drive is 256GB. This isn't a big deal since I am using this for work and more all of my files are saved on my employer's network anyways-Power brick uses that rectangle connection instead of USB-C. I think USB-C can pass enough power that it's work for this laptop (though I'm not 100% on that). However, that's not what this laptop uses, so it's a power brick you've got to travel with and can't lose (as opposed to USB being pretty universal on newer stuff)That's really about it. There is nothing I hate or strongly dislike about this laptop. Sometimes I can get the fans to run a bit for some of my more CPU intensive applications, but it's not bad. This thing doesn't heat up or get all that hot (at least I haven't found it to). Overall, this is a solid performer.Note: one of the other reviews mentioned the keyboard backlight. Yeah, it's a few different levels of cool white. it is not RGB (like in one of the main pictures on the listing). However, I really don't care about that, so no big deal.",5
738,Lenovo,"Brutally fast but will need upgraded! This laptop is a fantastic value for the price and is brutally fast at 1080p.But going into this you must know that unless you're content with just playing a couple of games, and most people are not, then you're going to need to dole out a bit more money, $100-200, in order to add an additional SSD to the laptop, which it does have a space for a secondary SSD.Now you could go with a 1Gb but I'd really recommend you save up and go for a 2Gb as you will find 1Gb runs out fast.Also the memory at 8Gb is likely borderline in need of an upgrade as well.But, knowing that going on and you will love this laptop.Setup is seriously easy and fast, I was done just by using my voice to command Cortana to setup Windows 10 in about 10 minutes.There is no bloatware that I found (although if memory serves there was some sort of virus protector trial period which I promptly removed, and I'd recommend you do the same, Windows defender will do you just fine without any subscription fees).The first game I tested I did run into issues and was unable to get it resolved and that was Doom eternal.It indicated that there was not enough memory in the graphics card to run the game.I thought this was due to it using the integrated (ie slow) graphics card rather than the discrete Nvidia 1650 (which is what you want to use) but even after disabling it I was unable to get Doom to run.A cursory glance around the internet appears that this is an issue with several brands of laptops so I moved on to something else: Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.Well if you know much about games it is not an easy game to run so if you can run Microsoft Flight Simulator well then you know you've got a keeper.I'm happy to say this game ran it without any issue at all and ran it extremely well.I also was able to run several other modern games without any issue at all and it seems like Doom was just a weird outlying anomaly.Do be sure when you're running games that you are using your Nvidia card though!Now, I've been running this laptop for about a week or so and never had it crash once.It boots up super fast into Windows 10, about 11 seconds it seems and is just a joy to use.And I am also driving a 1440p Acer Predator monitor now and games run just great at 1440p I should note.This machine is just a wonderfully light, fast game machine.All in all this is a fantastic value and appropriately priced.Keep in mind you won't fit a lot of games on the standard 256Gb hard drive and you also should know you don't want to fill up the hard drive completely as Windows 10 will need space in order to install updates and such.Adding an internal hard drive is fairly easy but if that scares you then you can always use an external and this laptop has the ports for it, but know externals do take a slight hit on speed.I love this machine and plan to use it as my primary machine when I am on the road.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",4
739,Lenovo,Good but falsely advertised Keyboard does not have the RGB Keyboard / just a white backlight instead. The images on Amazon are not accurate.,3
740,Lenovo,"Great Balanced Machine with Gaming Ability I was pretty excited to receive this IdeaPad Gaming 13 laptop.The idea of a fast computer, which was also capable of gaming was very appealing to me.I do want to note that the computer required being connected to power the first time I turned it on. Even though the battery was over 50 percent, it would not turn on until connected to power.The build of the machine is plastic, so you should be careful with it.Nevertheless, it looks good.In particular, I like the decision to include a small number pad to the right of the keypad.There are two USB A ports, one USB C port, headphone jack, HDMI, and ethernet.The Ryzen 5 5600H is a very quick processor that will take care of your general computing needs with lightning speed.The 1650 graphics gives you the ability to do some graphic intensive tasks like video editing, but also play some games!I installed steam and downloaded the 2013 Tomb Raider and Witcher 3. I could play the 2013 Tomb Raider at well over 60fps.Witcher 3 I could dial back the settings and get around 60fps, or put it to high settings and get 30fps locked.This isn't earth shattering gaming, but it's capable especially if you're willing to tweak the game's settings and get configuration you prefer either for frames or resolution.Also, be sure to click the battery icon in the taskbar and moved to max performance, before you start gaming.The battery is somewhat disappointing, but considering the computer is already pretty large and has some decent weight being a gaming computer with plenty of venting, I can live with it. In general, if you're going to game, you want to be plugged into power. If you're web browsing or listening to some music, you can get well over three hours without problem. However, if you're gaming on max performance, you will get under a hour of battery life.On the specs lists, the compromise on this machine besides an entry level gaming GPU, is the 256GB storage and 8GB of RAM.The 8GB ram can be upgraded pretty easily. There is a second slot if you take off the bottom of the computer.I'm going to bump mine to 16GB total soon. However, for many tasks, the 8GB is fine.There is also some adapters included that if you don't mind working with electronics, you can add a 2.5 inch SSD inside the machine to get more storage.I plan to do that eventually too.Again, unless installing large games like Witcher, if you're doing regular computing tasks, the 256GB storage will be ok for you.Overall, I am super impressed with this laptop.It presents a very good value.You can open this up and out of the box have a quick machine that can also play some games.The most serious gamer might not want it, but if you want to play games casually on a machine that can do your other tasks, this could be the one for you.Being a bit of a gaming machine, you get the benefit of a fast CPU and GPU no matter what takes you are doing, which is nice! The one reason you might not choose the notebook is if you never game nor do serious video editing, you might could pick a machine that was smaller/lighter since cooling isn't as important they make some really slick machines when they don't have to be able to handle gaming.Overall, very much recommended!",4
741,Lenovo,"Good for gaming and more My computer arrived. I like the shadow black color of thecasing.I like the even color of it.I like that even thoughthe casing is plastic it feels like a good quality plastic and does not feel cheap.I like the shape of the laptop.I like it has curved edges.I connected quickly to my wifi with no problems.I found the sound clear and crisp.I like that when I addedmy headphones it was much louder in sound.I like that the audio gives me a high definition sound and optimizesmy audio experience.I like I can go into the settings and change thingsaround for different sound experience depending on the gameI am playing.I heard no distortion in the sound.I found the key board to be quite comfortablefeeling on my fingers.I could type well andcould play games well on it.Me moving from key to keywas not a problem and the response time was fast.I like that it isone of the most smoothest keyboards I have ever used.I like the curved keys.I like the keyboard light color.I found that even though there is just onelight color you can dim it or turn it to high light.I found the brightness of keyboard lights pleasantly visual.I like it could handle the faster playing games.I like the anti-glare screen.I found it to work well.I found the refresh rate good.I only had minor lag and thatwas a really high data fast playing game.I also was on wifi and not Ethernetso that could be the reason.Though I did test Ethernet I did not do so while gaming.I like that it has AMD Ryzen 5600 H with it’s 6 cores.I like being a Nvidia owner already that it has Nvidia GeForcebuilt in to the gaming computer helping it to run smoothly.I like the memory that it has built in.I found it of adequate sizefor the money and of the same size as my other gaming computer.I like that it has 256GB M.2 PCLe SSD storage, meaning it runsat a faster pace than my sata drive computer does.I also like itcame with all material, casing, cables etc.,(except the extra SSD) to addanother ssd for more memory.I like the 8 gb DDR4 ram since it helps me play larger heavy datagames and the DDR stands for double data rate for anyone whodoesn’t know.I like that the weight of it is not as heavy as mostof the gaming laptops.I found it just a touch lighter thanmy other one of a different brand.It is easier to carry from place to place.I connected to Bluetooth 5.0 with no problems.I like that the Ethernet port worked well and fast downloading the games.I connected to the 65” big screen with a 4k HDMI and the picturewas crystal clear.I liked the webcam worked well at 720p HD.I very much like the privacy shutter.No more tape on the computercamera.I think everyone did that before a shutter.I found the micro phone to be clear to the person on theother side.No distortions in my voice.I liked the touch pad. I found it to work well, fast and be responsiveto my touch.I found the USB ports to work well also.I am not sure why thereis just two but I can add a external port expander cheaply if I need too.I found the headphone jack to work very well.I found the C plug to work well to connect my phone.I like the operatingsystem that comes on the computeras well for normal everyday working and browsing the web.I like that I could open 50 tabs (I stopped there) and I had no problemswitching back and forth between all 50 tabs.At 50 I got a small amountof lag that’s it.I don’t really know if anyone would need to openthat many tabs at once or not but I found this machine can handlethat if anyone is looking for that type of capability.I like it has a 135 watt power brick and it charges pretty fast.I like the Lenovo Vantage which monitors cpu usage, aide storage and checks my hardware.I like the Lenovo migration assistant that moved my files from my oldcomputer fast with out cables.I like that the battery life seemed to be pretty good.I am thinking it was 5 hours.I like that this is a mid priced gaming and home computerwith pretty fast speeds.I found the price comparable to other mid sized gaming computerswith out as much power as this one has.I have enclosed pictures so you can make a informeddecision based on your own personal needs.Yes I would recommend this product.",5
742,Lenovo,"Fantastic Laptop At A Good Value, But Shouldn't Be Marketed To Gamers This is a solid 5-star laptop for Productivity and it could even be marketed as a Performance computer.However, marketing this build as a ""gaming"" laptop is weak, at best, so I am assigning 4 stars overall.  I was excited to receive this laptop because I wanted a gaming computer I could dedicate exclusively to my Oculus VR games, freeing up my Alienware for other uses.Sadly, the graphics card that comes with this laptop (AMD Ryzan Vega 8 5000) just isn't strong enough.I'm honestly not surprised, because the price point on this laptop is just too low to have high expectations.If your gaming is limited to Fortnite and Overwatch, this GPU should perform fairly well, but will not be spectacular.If you are a hardcore gamer, this GPU simply isn't going to cut it.Gaming aside, what did I think of this laptop?It's AWESOME!PROS:(1) Very good video quality, even though it comes with integrated graphics(2) Great speed(3) Good quality integrated webcam, and I love the privacy slider on the camera(4) Nice feel when pressing the keys and great keyboard layout, including a number pad(5) Decent integrated audio(6) Battery life is very good(7) Fantastic price point (current selling price is $700)CONS:(1) No touchscreen!I'm very accustomed to using one and it will be very difficult to go without it when using this laptop.(2) Lenovo is marketing this setup to gamers without making it very clear that it is only suited for the most basic of 3D gamesOverall, this is a great computer for the price.In a benchmark test against other productivity/performance laptops and desktops, it scores remarkably well.It is great for household use, small businesses, video streaming, photo editing, and basic gaming.It isn't suited to medium or large sized businesses, or hard-core-gamers.",4
743,Lenovo,"Nice, upgradable computer. Mediocre for gaming. This machine comes with a capable mid-range AMD Ryzen 5 processor and a low end graphics card. The screen is non-touch 1080p FHD which is good, 4K is too high a resolution for a screen of this size. The key to the screen is its 120Mhz refresh rate. It will not be your bottleneck when gaming. At 250 NITs it is not very bright.The laptop comes with 8GB if ram in a single SODIMM. By adding 8GB to the other free slot you double the ram to 16gb and enable dual-channel memory for a speed boost. However, 16GB is not the maximum despite the answer by Lenovo in the answer section. I put in two 32GB SODIMMs and have 64GB of ram in my unit (the actual limit).In side it comes with a 256GB boot NVME. It is mid-range in speed. You add either another NVME or a 2.5 inch SSD. A kit is included with the laptop to add the SSD. I opted to add a 2 TB Inland NVME and left in the 256GB boot NVME. The boot NVME is the small size NVME, not full length so you have to find one like that to replace it, they are uncommon.The speakers are barely good enough to watch youtuber videos. I suggest you connect to a good Bluetooth speaker.In summary, I upgraded the memory to 64GB and the storage by adding a 2 TB NVME. This makes it a very cable workhorse computer to tackle most productive work loads while still enabling light gaming.",4

755,Chuwi,"Don't buy this for any reason! I purchased a Chuwi HeroBook 14, which is a total piece of garbage, even at their low price. The wifi connectivity was abysmal and the keyboard failed after a few months. Dealing with Chuwi’s so-called service and support was totally fruitless; they did absolutely nothing while taking forever to do it. Their response time for emails was often more than several weeks. They also wanted to charge me for a replacement keyboard which they would ship to me although the product was under warranty. They never offered to repair or replace the unit, and I would not trust them to do so. As a technology consultant, I have purchased thousands of devices for hundreds of clients, and I have sometimes had frustrating experiences with products and service, but I have never experienced such total failure as with Chuwi. I could never recommend any Chuwi product to anyone for anything.",1

The battery life is awesome. I have charged it one time and it has stayed closed when not in use, I open it back up and the battery is awesome. It transfers data so quickly! I had a dead hard drive from my old laptop which I put into a hard drive enclosure, hooked up to this new laptop, and within a couple of hours I had all the files transferred over to this new computer. And that old laptop was a 500gb hard drive!",4
763,Chuwi,"well built, should support windows 11 well built. battery life is so so. keyboard is as good as any macbook pro i have owned. trackpad isn't amazing, clicking takes a lot of force and gives it a slightly cheap feel. tracking is accurate though, single and double taps work very well. i have had some bluetooth audio latency issues where the output audio is slightly behind the video. not a huge problem. power connector is a little odd, small and seems fragile. screen is superb, even and bright. body is well built. a small usb-c hub deals with the lack of ports easily. been using it about a week so far and have had zero issues; updates, sleeping, restarting, powering on/off, all work without issue. fan only kicks on when expected and is a reasonable volume. at idle processor utilization hovers around 4-5%, unlike other chinese made intel based laptops i own.so far i've used this machine to edit a 1080p 120fps film project in premiere pro and its handled this task easily. that's not to say it will handle any film project, something with blurs, time warping, or other processor intense operations i bet it would struggle a bit but probably still be reasonably useable.if you treat this machine with a little care, eg. not yanking out the power cable, traveling with it in a padded sleeve, it should last a couple of years, if not more. especially with the ease of upgrades to the ram and hd. the only thing i am concerned about is the battery. will it maintain a charge beyond 1-2 years and will it bubble? if it dies prematurely or bubbles i doubt a replacement will easily be found.this laptop should support windows 11, the processor it uses is on microsoft's list of supported intel processors and has tpm 2.0.",5

I took a chance due to long back orders on all other computer brands at that time. It was a huge mistake that I regret. The chargers on both laptops broke within months. When I tried to contact the company to get replacement chargers I wasn't able to locate them by phone or online. I contacted Asurion, whom I purchased an extended warranty from, and they were also unable to get in touch with the company. Asurion offered to replace the chargers under my warranty. It took them over 60 days and numerous follow-up calls to send the replacement chargers. When I finally received the charges, neither of them worked.Don't purchase these laptops. And be cautious when purchasing ""protection plans"" for merchandise.",1
784,Chuwi,"Capable Linux Laptop with Some Tweaks Perhaps this review can help a specific group of people that may be interested in these CHUWI laptops.For several years, I've had a tweaked Lenovo 100S Chromebook running GalliumOS (Linux). Neat, useful, little all purpose machine. Great battery life but pretty weak on the specs, esp RAM @ 2GB. I wanted a new laptop that would do the following:1) Smoothly run any 'popular' Linux distro without a ton of effort,2) Have reasonable RAM/CPU specs,3) Have a greater than 1366x768 display,4) Be x86 architecture4) Be as low priced as possibleI feel these CHUWI laptops are fairly unique right now at ticking those boxes.It's been a few years since I've purchased a new, non-Chromebook laptop. My first attempt at going with an ASUS Zenbook equipped with a nice display, Ryzen 5 4000 series CPU, and NVIDIA graphics was a disaster.A simple lid close to standby in the year 2021 when on Linux just isn't possible on that machine. What the major manufacturers have done to cripple many of their latest machines in terms of limiting firmware-based power/standby options (S3 vs. S0ix ""Modern Standby"") is criminal. Not everybody wants to run Windows 10! There's a tech rabbit hole there I want no part of.When I saw that these CHUWI units were reported to be very Linux friendly, I had to give one a go. In the last month, I've now had two CHUWIs for evaluation.Ordered a CoreBook Pro after returning a similar GemiBook that had intermittent display issues out of the box. I don't know what the problem was with the GemiBook was but it definitely wasn't happy with certain video modes.Impressions on the CHUWI CoreBook ProVery reasonable build quality especially considering the price point. Solid chassis, keyboard feels decent enough. That display is the REAL DEAL. Nothing close at 2x the price outside of the other CHUWIs. That said, my display had pretty significant light bleed when dark but at any other time, it's just SPECTACULAR and VERY pretty to look at. Running fractional scaling in KDE leaves you with a modern, yet traditional desktop environment that's just a thing of beauty.Spent only enough time in Windows to image the machine and find the right Linux distro to install for light to moderate computing tasks. No games, media creation, or those type of things.I liked the small, svelte power supply on the GemiBook. The cord is longer on the 19V/3.42A two-piece CoreBook Pro charger but it's pretty large overall. That power plug is tiny and asking to be damaged. Getting between 4-5 hours running KDE Neon which is fine for my needs. For others, they might want more running time. I've had zero issues with performance thus far. Reasonably quick and snappy.The one issue that nearly drove me to returning the CoreBook Pro also was solved after some setting changes in KDE Plasma. For some reason, I was getting repeating/ghost keystrokes and input device delays that were screwing with usability. The keyboard and touchpad seem to be finicky devices and/or have less than ideal support currently in Linux land.The trackpad would also stop working when the keyboard was acting up. This behavior was consistent regardless of distro used. I was so frustrated because I felt like I was close to the ideal device for the price.In KDE Plasma settings, the following seem to have completely cleared up my input device issues.Hardware > Input Devices > Keyboard, 250ms delay and rate of 4 repeats/secHardware > Input Devices > Touchpad, Disable while typing OFFWould be great to have more than one USB 3.0 port. The camera isn't as horrible as I was thinking it would be given some reports. The speakers, well, yeah those are pretty bad. I'll probably add one of the EMTEC X250 M.2 SATA drives and call it done. I guess a Bluetooth mouse would free up that USB.All things considered, I would happily recommend the CoreBook Pro for the $338 I paid. It's a quirky little device and it's exactly what I was looking for.TL;DR: Wanted a small, decent spec (>Chromebook) laptop to run a standard Linux-based distro. Returned a GemiBook that had video issues for a CoreBook Pro. Running KDE Neon REALLY WELL with some minor input device tweaks. 4-5 hour runtime, usable backlit keyboard, the screen is FANTASTIC. I'm pretty happy thus far.",4

786,Chuwi,"Good performance, poor construction In terms of performance, I can’t fault the laptop. Fast powering on, able to run multiple apps (including 20+ tabs in Google chrome) without much of a lag.My biggest issue is the construction. The magnet keeping the lid closed is very strong, and as a result places immense pressure on the screws holding it together. It has been less than a year and I’ve already had to have all of the screw mountings replaced twice and they have now broken again, meaning I can’t close the laptop without everything falling apart. I’ve already spent over $100 repairing it, and will likely have to spend another $50 repairing it again.Rather spend some more money initially and buy a better laptop, than spend half the value on repairs in the first year.",2

The keyboard seems to be very good. The stylus also work as expected. The touch screen is also very good. All in all feels very much like a Surface Pro. At this point I would highly recommend this pc for every day use. Probably not for gaming. But that's not my interest. I'm going to use it as a work pc in the field.,5
794,Chuwi,"Dynamite in a small package! First of all, I love the Chewi - I received it last week and it is exactly what I wanted.I got it just for my Chess - I use it to read chess e-books (in installed software that one can read and see the pieces on a board; and watch the pieces more. And to sue to practice Chess using online sites as well as downloaded Chess programs.Like everything it has its quirks and getting used to it seems to be universal, regardless of what one buys. A peeve is that the volume is low, but with earphones, it's perfect. I haven't tried connecting my Bose to it yet. The bigger peeve is that I am unable to stop the keyboard display from popping up (on the screen) every time I touch the screen to select something or scroll, even when I have the keyboard attached. I hope this is a WIN10 switch. Another observation is that it sometimes doesn't boot with the keyboard attached, but it will without it. I also plugged the charger into the Audio-OUT hole overnight and, naturally it didn't charge. Tons of puns come to mind, but I will fight to ignore them all!BUT, having said that, I love the weight, it's feather light. The screen is bright, the keyboard is big enough for my hands, the pen is adequate. I haven't figured how to program it, or whether I can or not. A PDF Users manual would be nice too or a link to it would be very helpful (if it's there, I haven't found it yet). I haven't checked out the camera for my Zoom and Skype calls yet. I would like to have been able to add RAM to it - one can't have enough RAM and it never hurts!I have a 2TB external solid state drive with the rest of my files and it works seamlessly. My Office365 softwareworks fine.Could this have more stuff - sure! But for this price, for me, it's a steal and just PERFECT.I plan on updating this in a couple of months!Any suggestions about the keyboard are appreciated.",5

802,Chuwi,"Best bang for the buck I was hesitant about buying a Chinese made laptop from a company called CHUWI...lets start with that.I am not an avid gamer, or pc guru. I'm not on a computer everyday, for work, etc. I pretty much just surf google, youtube, facebook. A little bit of recording software, pictures, and droves of music in my library. I have seen many reviews on this laptop, and as a consumer I feel its important to convey my experience with it.I have had it for about 2 weeks, and maybe its just the excitement, but I have been using it non stop. things you will see or read about in reviews:Keyboard: Crazy enormous. I cant really tell you about keystroke and travel and all that good stuff. But I can tell you as someone who types on a keyboard very little, I'll need a little getting used to it. Not a bad thing.Screen: Is it a RETINA display....no, not even close. But for watching UHD and 4K videos, its no slouch. looks good, bright screen, smooth color, and transitions. Matte finish on the screen, great for anti glare.Speakers: Ok... this is my only real complaint. It is the most horrid sound I've probably ever heard. the speakers are buried somewhere under the display? maybe? It basically sounds like its coming from another room when its actually on your lap. I understand a laptop may not be ideal for listening to music, or hearing audio... but this is sooooo bad. For the price... I can live with it, BT headphones or speaker, and all is well.Actual performance: Fantastic! So the 16gb of ram, and 256 SSD is what sold me. Ill probably never come close to using ram like that, but one thing I've learned about electronics, is headroom. Always go with a little {or alot} more than you actually need, you don't want to run you computer at full bore all the time.Wifi card is meh... after reading reviews I ordered the EDUP wifi extender and use that instead of the internal card. Not that its terribly bad, I just wanna go a little faster. On 5Ghz wifi, this computer is soo fast with loading anything. Its so snappy, almost instantaneous. In my opinion that means the most to me...the performance.Physical laptop: looks like a giant Macbook...looks can be deceiving. It looks great, honestly I love the aesthetic, but its plastic... again not a deal breaker, but make sure you order a nice padded case for it. it flexes quite a bit when just picking it up, I feel like I need to maybe... be a little gentle with it? But for the price, compromises must be made. CHUWI has a few different lines of laptop, that all look pretty sweet, not gunna lie.I love this laptop, it has everything I could ever need, for years to come. For the price, I am EXTREMELY satisfied. For me, the true value lies in the price to performance ratio. Is this a $1600 laptop... no. But, it performs like one, and that is what matters to me. I spent a literal week straight researching this specific laptop. I watched every video, and read about 30 different reviews. I am undoubtedly happy with this computer, I'm ordering one for my daughters birthday, and I would recommend this laptop to anyone",5
803,Chuwi,"Do not buy from this company Worked like it should until a week after the return window . Motherboard has a problem and ICan’t get it repaired, no parts available per my computer shopand no help on the website.Amazon please stop selling this product",1

809,Chuwi,"Budget friendly, Money goes where it matters All the RAM you could need, a dedicated graphics processor, separate nu.ber pad and a huge screen. There's a few caveats. The four speakers are kind of a joke. They're all stacked right next to each other off center to the right above the keyboard. I though half the speakers were broken when I first got it. The body casing is a little flimsy. If you're rough with your electronics, don't get this. If you treat them well, this won't be a problem. I wish the processor was a little more powerful, but a casual user this is all I need. This will not work for any gaming, it simply doesn't have the processing power. The power is good and gesture controls make the pad easy to use. The left and right click aren't discernable, it's a little clunky sounding too. I really can't complain though. This is exactly what I needed for work and I saved several hundred by not chosing a brand name. I'm happy with this.",4

811,Chuwi,"Not working in < 4 month after purchase a brand new one. Unbelievable! I bought this laptop on April 4. It looked good when I received it, except the power cord is very short. But in less than 4 month after my purchase, one day, when I flip open the laptop, the laptop is asking me to select a ""keyboard layout"". No matter what I tried, the laptop won't boot up. I am shocked!Since this is a no brand laptop, I bought a 2 year protection plan with extra tech support, but the tech support is a joke. After more than one week of phone call trying to reach someone to solve my boot up issue, finally Amazon insurance company Asurion told me to ship back my laptop to their tech support center for inspection. After they received my returned laptop. They issued a gift card to me equal to the laptop price I paid, but I lost my tax paid to Amazon and the 2 year protection plan.This is my worst Amazon purchase experience.",1

821,Chuwi,Great simple tablet. I use it recreationally. Battery life is not the best. Great screen clear picture,5
822,Chuwi,"Great for watching video, not for gaming. I held off for a long time trying to find more info about this tablet, and could not find much. The main thing I wanted was something to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Youtube at decent resolution. This screen, at 12 inches, is 2160x1440, which is perfect resolution for that size. A higher resolution, like 4k, would be wasted, since my eyes cannot detect 4k on a small screen. I was curious if it would still play 4k, particularly from Youtube, which it does. Although, the screen is 50hz, so it will drop frames when playing 4k 60fps to match the 50hz screen. I did hook it up to a 4k monitor using hdmi and it does play 4k at 60 fps although it skips for the first few seconds while loading, then plays 4k fine only dropping a few frames over the next ten minutes.I did get the stylus and keyboard with the tablet, Windows 10 works better with a keyboard and mouse/trackpad than as a stand alone tablet. The H6 stylus is usable, but not top of the line. There is a little trouble with the stylus running smoothly over the screen protector, and the stylus works much better around the edges of the screen if you have it in tablet mode.Battery lasts around 4 hours while watching 4k video, which is not too bad. I do like the DC charger, that way I don't cover up the one USB C port when charging. Supposedly you can charge from the USB C, but I've read a couple reviews that mentioned rumors of there being a problem with the type C charging, so I haven't bothered in trying it.All in all, I'm glad I got this tablet, I'm using it mostly as a media device which is what I wanted. It can handle most tasks, but is not a strong tablet for gaming, although it can be linked to an xBox like most Win10 computers, although I haven't tested that out yet.",4
823,Chuwi,"Buyer Beware, Windows would not activate, no contact from CHUWI after multiple attempts First, the good - The hardware works as advertised, it's responsive and all the functions work. However, the speakers on the tablet are basically non-existant.With the volume at 100% you can barely hear them.But the audio out the 3.5mm port works fine.It also works fine going out the USB C port to a dock.I would also think that bluetooth speakers would work as well but I didn't have bluetooth spearkers to test.You need to turn on battery saver all the time and turn down the display to 25% to get the life out of the battery that the description says.Only issue I can see with the hardware are the speakers, while I wouldn't expect B&O or Beats quality at the price point, I would expect something more than what they deliver.The unit I got had some bubbles in it straight out of the box but they don't interfere with the display.Now for the bad,Windows 10 will not activate, Microsoft activation servers report invalid key.I tried contacting CHUWI support using their supprt email from their web site. I sent them screen shots of the failed activation along with a copy of the invoice from Amazon Response was supposeed to be within 48 hours.Four days later, still nothing.I tried their suport forum, there was no response from the company there either.I tred once again to contact support but it's been almost two weeks now with no response from the company.There are no drivers available for the UBook X from their web site.All indications are that a fresh installation of Windows and the rotation function of the tablet and their proprietary pen longer works.I searched their forums and found a link to a third party site for UBook generic drivers, these drivers did not work.Another user on their forums indicated that they wanted the drivers from CHEWI for the UBook X but never got a response from them. I tried the generic drivers after a clean instalation of Windows and either drivers were not found or Windows reported an error adding the drivers and recommended contacting the manufacturer's wersite.No drivers, no clean install of WindowsThere appears to be no specific warranty available from CHUWI.While the warranty is described in detail on their web site, there is no definate time period given.It only says ""CHUWI warrants the original purchaser that your CHUWI product shall be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period aforementioned."" There is nowhere on their site that says how long the warranty period is.I check the warranty information from Amazon and it referes you to CHUWI. You obtain warranty service by contacting CHUWI by their email address that I tried when trying to get my Windows activation issue resolved.No specifics on length of warranty and no response from comnpany using the email specifcally for warranty issues.The only warranty you are going to get for this is from Amazon's 30 day return policy. Or a third party warranty such as Square Trade.The description on Amazon indicates that the M.2 SSD can be upgraded, however there is no documenation provided anywhere on how to do this.Summary,Good hardware platformWindows will not activateNo documentationNo drivers availableUnclear warrantyNo response from company.Hardware rates a 4 due to the speaker issue, lack of documentation, no drivers available, bubbles on the display, and Windows not activating takes this rating to a 1.Lack of company repsone would take the rating to a 0 if I could rate it a 0.Don't buy it.",1
824,Chuwi,"Not built for geeks Overall, it's not a terrible tablet if you don't have anything to compare it to. I am really trying to find a Windows tablet with data capability, a wide, bright display screen, and good battery life. A 5000maH battery on a PC tablet will not get you thru much of a day. Battery drains pretty fast. It did not have data capability, though I thought I read it had eSim capability. The biggest disappointment was the speakers. They were really bad. You will definitely need to connect it to a BT speaker to have decent sound.",3
825,Chuwi,"Useless without a Keyboard What is the point of selling a tablet like this without a keyboard?And, if one is going to sell a tablet like this without a keyboard, wouldn't it make sense to also sell keyboards separately?Apparently this logic doesn't apply.Thinking I got a good deal, I purchased this Chuwi UBook X 12 Touchscreen 2-in-1 tablet.As I needed to save some money and, assuming like any normal company, I could purchase a keyboard later, as the bundles were pricey.Wrong, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.I've now had to return two keyboard cases which claimed to fit this hunk of junk AND a keyboard 'stand' by another company that also didn't fit.I've searched both online and all over Seattle to try and find even just a blue tooth case which I can use.Again, no such luck.So, I have a useless piece of technology sitting abandoned on my dining room table.I was a fool to buy this thing. Don't make the same mistake as did I.",1

828,Chuwi,"Satisfied Overall a great tablet / computer. I think it's littel slow to run Windows 10, And that's his big downside. When running on Windows there is a feeling that it is not running smoothly.I intalled on that also ubunto and Chrome OS (Total 3 operating systems thar I can choose which to run)The Chrome OS runs almost perfectly. Everything is smooth and fast. I was surprised to find that this is a really convenient operating system.There are some issues with the HDMI port with Chrome OS but it is negligible because I can just run Windows when I want to connect to an external monitor.Overall I am satisfied.",4
829,Chuwi,This laptop is garbage Garbage. Could even work on it once because the laptop wasnt charging and only had battery power. Bought another charger to no avail. No trying to return this piece of garbage and hopefully get my money back,1

836,Chuwi,"Great purchase. I was skeptical about getting this laptop because of other reviews. I however am very pleased with this laptop. It is very thin, so thin that it was mistaken as a tablet instead of a laptop. To me because I use it for homeschooling my children, the battery life is accurate. In idle it lasts a whole day, the battery life is dependent upon how active you are on the laptop. Coming from a tablet that only had a 2 hour window and couldn't be charged while being used, this laptop is a blessing. I love the screen quality and the feel of the keys. I specifically picked this laptop because the newer ones don't have as many ports as this one.However, with many things going to Bluetooth capabilities, you can use the USB ports for more important things.",5
837,Chuwi,"DISSAPPOINTED! I bought this device in December and to day it is not powering up.The unfortunate thing is that, this occur outside of my return deadline.Amazon sent a query to the supplier and advise that I will get response from the supplier within 24 - 48 hours.We are now beyond 48 hours and I have not heard from the supplier. I am really disappointed in this product and also with the supplier.Id strongly advise against the purchase of this product",1
838,Chuwi,"Good for office work and word processing but that's really it For starters, if you are looking for something that will play games or that will have a lot of processing power, this is not your laptop. It takes a good moment to load thumbnails of document folders which is upsetting from a device with a solid state drive and 16 gigs of RAM, but not unexpected from a Celeron.The keyboard seems somewhat sturdy. Not a big fan of the power button location. I have hit the power button 4 times now while thinking I was hitting the delete key. It is rather frustrating but what are you going to do?The screen looks good. I can see a bit of color flex at the bottom where the hinges are when I move the screen to close it so hopefully this has no long term effects. Size is decent and for what I use this for it is great.There is only 1 USB 3.0 port and 1 USB-C port. You will need a USB 3.0 hub and a USB-C to HDMI adaptor if you want to hook this up to an external source. Otherwise you can only use one external device at a time, which I highly recommend be a mouse as this is not the greatest trackpad in the world.All in all I bought this for the ability to have something compact, light weight, and to take back and forth between my office and my jobsites without much of an issue. The entire scope of this laptop for me was ultimately to use Microsoft Office in the field and to process data as I needed to. This so far has accomplished all of that so I can't really complain too much.**EDIT** I am not sure why, but when this computer was designed the Manufacturer decided that it would install a feature that turns the backlit LEDs for the Keyboard off after a few seconds of non-use. There is no way to change the ""sleep"" feature as I guess you would call it. Crazy.**EDIT #2** I can't do it guys. I am going to return this and pay the restocking fee. The person who put this processor in this computer should be fired.",2
839,Chuwi,Awesome I like how sleek it is but more importantly how fast it is and all the space it came with. Great for college students.,5
840,Chuwi,"cpu only downside to this laptop is that the cpu is celeron which is a really bad cpu for a laptop with these kinds of specs, but i got it for my dad to do his school work n he likes it so if u want a nice looking laptop with a metal body and ips display to do basic things then go for it",5

842,Chuwi,"Cheap, misleading, absolute joke Other than the display, this laptop is laughably bad. Right out of the box it wouldn't boot! Its as if someone already had it and didn't allow windows to properly install. Frustrating right out of the gate, I had to reinstall windows on my own from a boot drive. From there I thought maybe it was just a hiccup, and could be forgiven if it was a good product.IT. IS. NOT.This laptop can barely handle windows 10. Ridiculously slow, and I'm pretty sure the specs don't even match the amazon listing! The display is great but WHAT is the point of it if I have to decrease the resolution to make the thing usable??? And then EVERY TIME the thing has to update windows, it literally takes over an hour! I mean its almost like they dug in the electronic recycle bin and slapped old pieces together with a nice display to rip someone off. Average Chinese crap.",2

Initially I ordered it because of it's low price, but never expected it to be such a great buy. Love the looks and feel of it. It is super thin, light, great resolution, perfect for travel. In my opinion, it is just as good or better than laptops that cost twice as much. For an extra $20. I purchased an 256GB SD card and tripled the capacity. I truly recommend it!",5
845,Chuwi,"Suitable for Office applications and light web surfing. This laptop is a budget laptop with good value. The battery life is adequate and the display quality is very good. However, don't expect it to do everything for you. The processor is not the newest one so it would only suit for most office applications (word, powerpoint, etc.) and light internet browsing. The downside of this laptop is that it seems to have a very weak heat-dissipating mechanism (not a metal base shell but plastic), so the processor heat up really quick when you doing something a little complicated, and will stop boosting to a higher working frequency to prevent overheat. I think that's the reason why most users complained about its low performance.This laptop is light and the keyboard response is good. If you are looking for a compact laptop for light tasks, it might be suit for you.",4

849,Chuwi,"5 Star & Amazing Value - Best Out There In looking at some of these other reviews, keep in mind some people are not knowledgeable about electronics, and some are not even knowledgeable about anything.I say this only because a few bad apples could have ruined it for me, deterring me from trying this beautiful machine.For instance, some people don't know that Windows 10 has a performance vs battery saving mode, and it's set to battery saving mode by default, seeming to make it ""slow,"" lol.This laptop is perfect... why?Because it provides two premium key features in exchange for providing a few sub-par things that are of no significance anyway (mentioned in the cons section).To explain 1) you get an absolute gorgeous screen, atune to something you would find on a high end purchase, something rare in the tablet / small laptop world.2) you get Windows 10... and this means support into the future, likely, because Windows does a great job supporting legacy devices, and will likely continue.This means no throwing away other proprietary laptop systems and filling up landfills when drivers and updates discontinue.Benefits:-Exceptional and rare 5 star screen-Great battery life-Fast performance, handles anything I throw at it reasonably well (after all though, this is a portable laptop, suitable for entertainment and business purposes)-Thin and nice looking design-Keyboard and mouse respond smooth and accurate-Has brand name components internally that I see in some big brand new companies (don't be fooled just bc the name says Chuwi on it)-Windows 10 (think, no waste)-Has a SanDisk micro slot (I put a class 10 400GB card in there and now it's like I have a 500GB hard drive)-To open up the laptop, you unscrew screws on bottom, so you can replace the battery in the future.Many tablets and laptops cheaply require pry tools-Long term valueCons:-Plastic shell... what did you expect?You can't have everything.Don't drop it and do a reasonable job taking care of it-Bad camera and speakers... this is common in pretty much all laptops.Get your own Bluetooth earphones and your own camera (or use your smartphone for video, lol).Look for Bluetooth earphones that have replaceable batteries (instead of the usual trash it theme)If you have some common sense and take care of it, this will be the best portable laptop ever with long term value (though it's always good to have a second expensive laptop performer tied down as a workstation like people used to do with desktop computers).I'm thankful Chuwi had the consideration to develop such an excellent high end value for long term use in exchange for passing on having what would be subpar speakers at best anyway.For the essential portable needs, this is all 95% of us need for business / entertainment for the foreseeable future, all for under $300!!!",5
850,Chuwi,Good do far So far so good. Last CHUWI lost battery power after a few years. Not replaceable.Keyboard almost as big as last one. Plenty of sports. Lighter than last model.,5

857,Chuwi,Will break down on you! This laptop is horrible. I've had it for a year now and the screen just went blank for no reason. I can tell it is on because the power button is lit up. Other than that nothing. Trulya waste of my money!!,1
858,Chuwi,"Absolutely Disappointing This was such a disappointment, words cannot describe the crazy problems with Windows booting and password problem which we couldn't fix even with a new installation of Windows 10.

Chuwi tells me the same thing, that they can't help me and I need to go back to the seller. I send them screen shots showing them that they are the seller with the company name and address. It does not good. I'm stuck in a viscous circle of everyone telling me that the other person is responsible. On the Amazon site it says that the product is warranteed for 12 months.

862,Chuwi,"2nd PC I bought from the Bmax team It’s starts a little slow the first time you run it out of the box. It comes out of it and speeds up considerably once you run all the Windows updates and let it sit for an hour or two. It’s just win 10 runs a service in the background when you first install Windows to make it run as efficiently as possible so that process makes it seem slow while it configured. Give it sometime it will run great. The only small issue is the power cord is a little short and I’d like a power pack that was behind the plug to fit better on a power strip. Either way, I hope these guys keep going I’m rooting for you Bmax.",5

864,Chuwi,"Worth the money for office use and small entertaining purpose I made a purchase for this one after checking the specifications and the price and feel it would be worth for my daily work check. It comes in a package like a small hand carry suitcase which looks professional to me with really good packing for the laptop. The size is quite compact and handful for 13.3'' laptop and with optical keyboard so it fits well to the daily task use. The specs are quite good on this one which it has 8GB DDR4 RAM and that would help me run several office tasks at a time. I'm not really fond of the 128GB SSD because it's not enough for storage but it can be upgraded later when I need it to run smoothly so it's not big matter for me. The intel N3550 is more suitable for office use and small entertaining purpose because it can handle well these tasks after I tested it with different applications including games, music player, web browser, render programs. Overall, I think this is a really good made laptop for my daily check as I will need it to focus on work, but not other purpose like gaming, editing.",4
865,Chuwi,"Good with a few issues This machine is built very well and quality throughout. My only issues were a non-lighted keyboard, and for 8 gb of ram, it's slower than it should be. After using for a few days, I do like the machine. I'm only using for iTunes and HD tracks. My macbook air is getting full so this was a bargain.

One that he could do his school work due to covid and the kids spending so much time at home . Plus he play games or watch movies if he wanted. This computer was a great match for him as it works on windows 10. It runs on intel celeron with 8gb of ram and 128 gb ssd. We liked that it has expandable storage. The screen is big at 13.3” plenty big enough to do work or watch Netflix.It has a built in 720p he camera so perfect for his online classeswhere they all have to be in a video chat. The battery itself can last 5 hours before needing to be recharged. It weighs less than 3 pounds. Light enough to carry in his backpack to school . The keyboard keys are easy to read and bright white. It was just right for my budget and very cost friendly.This laptop is an amazing deal for this cost as everything g seems to move smoothly and runs at a great speed. I definitely feel like this laptop would work great for any student having to spend time at home for school due to covid . The only thing I wish they added was a cd rom. Good thing g they sell those cheaply and can be plugged in the USB port.We are overall very satisfied with this laptop!!,5

The speed is very fast and it loads any website very quickly. it does not replace a computer ,but it's perfect if you are just using it to search the internet or using it to type up a quick document. It's perfect for high school kids or middle schoolers. It has decent storage space. This is a great starting computer for your kids or even just internet surfing for your kids. You are able to connect a 3.0 port mouse to it. The keyboard is great. The battery life is great. Last a very long time. I also love that the laptop is very light weight.

The next cheapest we could find was the Microsoft Surface Go with 8GB RAM for around $550.00 and we can buy two of these for that!

Not sure if it's just my unit or all in production.Also, this works fine with driving a projector bur only from its micro HDMI to normal HDMI on a projector. The projector never could get a signal with the other connections ports.Also, most of the advertisements on these mobile projectors say they are not recommended for Power Point Presentations.I don't know why these say that.

There are instructions on the website for installing Ubuntu, and they inconveniently tell you **at the end** that changing the function of the Chinese character key requires a Windows installation, so thanks for that GPD.I discovered that Manjaro GNOME edition works 100%. No messing with system files, no weirdness with a rotated screen, everything works perfect after installation.To enable scaling options beyond 100% and 200%, Run the following command in a terminal:sudo nano /etc/gdm/custom.conf Place a ""#"" before the line ""WaylandEnable=false"" to comment that line out. Press CTRL + X, then Y to confirm save, then ENTER to confirm file name. Run the following command in a terminal:gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features ""['scale-monitor-framebuffer']"" Restart the system for changes to take effect.I think 150% is perfect for the screen size.BATTERY:Battery life is 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. I wish it were more but with how I use it it’s never been a problem for me. However, the battery died within a year of purchasing it. I contacted GPD and they suggested contacting the Amazon seller.

887,Chuwi,"Battery will not hold a charge It has a great small form factor that is unfortunately hampered by a battery that will not hold a charge if left unused for a little while.Customer service requests appear to fall into a black hole, with no responses from my requests.Unless you plan on using this everyday, you will want to pass on this one.",1
888,Chuwi,"Win 8.1 (and) Win 7 works quite well on it I didn't like the Windows 10 that came on it so I installed Windows 8.1 Professional x64.It works quite well.The touchscreen and wifi, ssd and touchpad were no problem at all, but did take hunting down a few drivers. The Touchscreen is very sensitive and quite accurate. The Touchpad is also likewise ver sensitive and quite accurate.The keyboard does a good job of eliminating keys that aren't used very much and freeing up space around keys like the arrow keys to reduce errors when using them. The ""semicolon"" was the only key I wish were easier to get to but its been turned into a two keystroke key, which you get used to fairly quickly.The keys on the keyboard are 'island style' like on a Mac book pro, with a recessed well from the surrounding keyboard bezel.It plays back video very well. But the video GPU and the Chipset don't have an official supported device driver from Intel so it defaults to the Windows built-in generic, which means you can't select alternate denser or lower resolutions. But its so fast in default mode this is really not noticeable.Windows 8.1 pro is still supported for a few more years, so its secure, but it doesn't get annoying broken updates every two weeks like Windows 10, so its much more stable.Windows 7 actually does install on it and runs quite well. The trick was the recent Retro invention of a GOP with Bios graphics support which fully enabled its installation without a legacy BIOS. It works even after install for things like error message screens and dumps which require the legacy BIOS support. The native NVMe universal driver for Windows 7 also made it possible to install direct to the SSD without needing to hack any load on demand third party drivers. And the twirly primary colored balls work in the Win7 start up screen.There is no touchscreen driver that I'm aware of but the touch pad works quite well, its very sensitive. Its not fully gesture enabled, but a two finger tap substitutes for a right click as opposed to a left click of the mouse page.All in all its supports Window 7 quite well for running older applications and using an OS with a 'completely' functional Start button.. with no ads or app store.",5

890,Chuwi,"Nice portable mini laptop But... It is a nice laptop for portability and speed, however, the downsize is the KEYBOARD which is really hard and annoying to use. Keyboard layout is so messed up that makes it impossible to type on. If you are a typist, forget about using this keyboard as you'll keep hitting the wrong keys. I really hate it. Get very frustrated every time using the keyboard to type. This is a really major problem. Battery life also sucks. It drains very quickly. The price is also horrendous. Better of going for MacBook Air if you're willing to spend this much of the money. I paid over 950 dollars for this and regretting it.",3

But before I knew it, I turn it on and the camera stops working. Tried all the online instructions and reached out to Amazon support and Bmax support. Bmax support never answered. Next issue, blue screen starts popping up and the computer begins to crash.You get what you pay for.",1
892,Chuwi,128gb not a 256gb Description said it was 256gb..I received 128gb. Very disappointed,1
893,Chuwi,Gave it Away I liked the price but I hated the keyboard as no spring action to the fingertips and too touch sensitive .. so found myself all over the screenI ended up handing it over to my daughter and buying a replacement HP,3
894,Chuwi,"Large Screen - Large Touchpad for my DIY custom craft both at home or on the road use Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I purchased this laptop to both large screen with large keyboard to use with all my creative DIY workbench peripherals both at home or take with me to craft show or fundraiser event.These devices include a cameo silhouette 3 vinyl cutter, and epson printer that was converted to sublimation printing, Ender pro 3D printer, and atomstack laser engraver.Another feature that grabbed my attention to this BMAX 2021 laptop was the large touch pad to use when using the vector drawing and lasergbrl software for my custom creations home business.When I powered this laptop on, I was going through the initial windows 10 setup screens and the display had a reduced screen with large black bars on each side but did revert to full screen display after windows setup.The preparing for use after initial setup only took 2.5 minutes or 180 seconds before I was able to see the desktop and start using the laptop.But when I launch Windows Update it required Windows 20H2 update in addition to several other critical and vulnerability updates.This is not a fault against the laptop but is always the case with Windows operating software.My Google Chrome browser was up to date build and in English not Chinese as mentioned in older opinions.This must have been changed in the 2021 version for this laptop.Battery was slightly precharged with 67% and 3 hours 40 minutes remaining - This estimate was with Wifi active but no devices were plugged into the USB ports or active bluetooth connection.I was very impressed with the speed and response with this 8gb/256gb configuration that I purchased and was able to even edit basic videos with cyberlink powerdirector without having to have the intense gpu.The keyboard took a bit of getting used to move from a full sizedesktop keyboard to having all the keys together.This resulted in a reduced right SHIFT key but appreciate full size arrow keys nested between the keys and numeric keypad, and I am very pleased with the power button placed at the upper most right above the numeric keypad away from the backspace and delete.That is huge pet peeve and annoyance for me when using chromebooks since I accidentally power down or put the book to sleep when the power key is in the same vertical position as the enter key.The BMAX layout avoids that issue with its design.The touchpad is huge and responsive that allows me to travel the entire screen when drawing or having to use multi-gesture actions.I did not test the headset jack yet to see if this was mic/headphone or just headphone out. But have used the microSD / TF card slot for downloading pictures or files to transfer to the 3d printer.My only suggestion for future models is to add a Type C usb port or full size HDMI port while keeping the thin profile.This laptop does include a Type C mini-HDMI but my external portable monitor is thin and only has Type C mini-hdmi or Type C USB ports.I needed to either purchase a Type C mini HDMI to Type C mini HDMI ( I could only locate 2 of them online ) or purchase an adapter that is Type C mini HDMI with a Female Type A port so I can use the cable that comes with my portable monitor.The lack of Type C USB port on the laptop forces me to use legacy Type A USB hubs that provides all the ports like VGA, RJ45 ethernet, and more usb ports.",5
895,Chuwi,Great value Quick shipping. Very nice computer. Great value.,5
896,Chuwi,Good for the price Good price nice big screen and love the keyboard too bad it doesn’t have any Microsoft programs,4
897,Chuwi,you can use this computer to do programming and even build database I absolutely love this laptop so far I'm still getting to know this laptop if there is any drawbacks for me its the fact that the words are dull on the screen and I'm near sighted. So its a bit fuzzy and I only get the trial version of Microsoft words.,4
898,Chuwi,"Don't like the mouse I really like this laptop except the mouse doesn't work very well and the size of the mousepad is so big, it gets in the way when I'm trying to type.",4

900,Chuwi,"Heavier than I imagined it would be but still packs quite a good punch into the small size! It took a while to research, find and finally install a word processing program.This was only due to my total ignorance of this process. There are a lot of programs out there!I had presumed that if it had Windows10 as a processor that it would have all the programs on there I wanted too.I did read all the write-ups and reviews about the computer and totally forgot this one minor detail when making my assessment which was mainly about ease of use and picture quality.I've had it for a week and I am still trying to get used to being mouseless. Not sure how much more of this I can take but I'm really going to try.There are lots of mouses out there for laptops, I know, but I'm not going to start looking until I'm desperate.The trackpad is huge but has a few areas where it is more sensitive than others as far as clicking on it to place the cursor.To scrollup and down you have to run your fingers absolutely vertical and not sideways at any degree. Zooming in and out takes practice. Just learned how to highlight text for editing.I also bought a wireless printer and was able to get the laptop to communicate with it without any problems at all. Yay me!For the last 30 years my husband has always taken care of purchasing our computers and making sure they run correctly. This time I'm on my own so this review has been written from a 63yr old's total rookie viewpoint been there for not much in the way of any technical opinions. I still have to hook up my external drive that has thousands of photos on it. This shouldn't be a problem but I will be holding my breath while I do it later on today.All in all, I think this is a great computer, super value for money and I'm excited about exploring it some more to see what it can really do!",5

It appears the micro SD slot works, but is simply upside down compared to every other micro SD slot I have ever used. I thought it was broken.Otherwise the machine appears to work as advertised.Update: Unfortunately, the ""G"" key is not right, and is permanently pressed so a slight tough activates it without the solid click the rest of the keyboard exhibits. This is a bummer, given I have already installed and activated hundreds of dollars of software licenses that I cannot re-install on a replacement machine. Bummer.",3

It doesn't even work as a typewriter, because I can't print anything.This computer sucks. Run, RUN. RUN!",1
942,MSI,It's a shame This would be the perfect laptop if MSI would have put a better battery on it. I won't complain too much because I use it mostly at home and in the office plugged in to power.But if you need it to work or play on the go look somewhere else.,4
943,MSI,Truly the best value laptop maybe even pc Arrived quickly and neatly packaged. Has been nothing but good and I can’t list a true con about the machine.Turn the settings to extreme performance and run almost any title at 100fps with DLSS and Reflex.Only regret is trying to decide between laptops for a week and not buying this sooner.From looking around you can’t find any PC with a RTX30 series card for $1500.,5
944,MSI,Not up totask for heavy gaming use The MSI GAMING LAPTOPS WERE FOUND TO BE FAULTY. OVERHEATING AND DEFECTIVE KEYBOARDS PROVED TOO PROBLEMATIC AND WERE RETURNED.,1
945,MSI,"FEATURES GALORE! Not gonna lie, super impressed with this laptop. Was considering an HP Spectre or Galaxy Book Pro, but stubled across this on here of all places. It hadeverything i was looking for & more than what I even realized.Presentation in box was nice. Like how it is packaged in a dust sleeve & even has a dust sleeve inbetween screen & keyboard. Major plus mark for that alone.Upon booting first time & getting initially set up, enjoyed how nice the screen is. IPS is the way to go, ngl. Keyboard light & RGB options are a major upgrade for my use. Selection of apps & programs from the get go are too numerous to mention, but is nice to have plenty of options. After removing what didn't interest me, proceeded with updates, as you should with any device.This thing seems like Sonic... GOTTA GO FAST!Dragon Center App has tons of various tweaks & options for things like Keyboard RGB light, Power/ Battery, Performance, etc. Definite plus for that alone.Yes, the fans can he EXTREMELY NOISY... BUT for my particular usage & wants in a laptop, quite a fair trade off. Only way they get THAT noisy, is if you select extreme performance/ cooler boost. A good pair of headphones would drown that noise.Another surprise, is that you can run android games either through The appropriate MSI app or even Bluestacks... was not aware of when I decided to purchase, but cool nonetheless.With this, I plan on investing in Steam, finally. Not to mention, can't wait to see what this thing can handle, emulation-wise (Can't wait to try Stepmania on this).Build seems solid. Got the Gray version & am not disappointed at all by my choice.This may be The best ""budget"" gaming laptop out there atm. Got the 512 GB Model with 16 GB ram & the RTX 3060. Going to eventually go overkill with max ram & a 2 tb Samsung SSD. Can't wait to see what this thing can unleash then... but for now, happy camper!",5
946,MSI,A lot of bloatwear well at least to me. But good over all. Overall it’s a good laptop but there’s a few things I need to know I chose this because it was the best option for me but for most people if you really care about the specs you will know that this is a i7 with only four cores and 8 threads. So in a way this is like a underpowered i7 which is fine considering how thin this laptop is. After putting all the drivers up-to-date and doing all the windows updates it runs perfectly smooth.,4
947,MSI,"Elegant and light weight gaming laptop Nice laptop, surprisingly thin, light weight.I like it.",5
948,MSI,"Great For Studying And For Gaming As an upcoming college student who enjoys to play games but still needs a laptop to study on, I found that this laptop is exceedingly capable of doing both. Take this review with a grain of salt however as I am not really knowledgeable of the exact specs of the laptop and what the technical terms necessarily means. But what I know for sure is that this laptop is great for a combination of studying and gaming as 15.6' screen is the perfect balance between gaming laptop and a Chromebook, thus, not taking up all your desk space and allowing room for textbooks and journals, while still allowing for a comfortable screen size for gaming. The only true worry I have about the laptop is how hot it can get by just having the laptop in ""Balanced Mode"", a mixture between power saving and quality frames and resolution, near the vents. But I am sure this can be somehow dealt with either through adjustments, either through changing settings and another way. Overall, the MSI 15m Stealth is a great laptop for a student who wants to dabble in gaming alongside his studies at a great price as well.",5

953,MSI,"Specs look good, but it has started freezing and crashing after a month I initially loved this laptop; the specs are good and the price was right. Using it for gaming and general computing seemed to be going well. Frame rates have been good and the screen is very nice.HOWEVER, I just passed the return window, and now the computer has started freezing and crashing periodically. If you search online you'll find that this is a common issue for this generation of MSI laptops, and apparently I'm out of luck now and stuck with a laptop that might freeze at any point.You might get lucky and get one that doesn't have the freezing issue, but then again you might get one like mine.",2
954,MSI,"Overall good product I have this GL75 Leopard MSI laptop, boots up fast, screen resolution excellent. Happy to acquired for my business. I would add more memory to max and add an additional hard drive in the next month.Battery doesn't seem to last over 4 hours of use.",5

Battery life is short lived so if you are a gamer, bring the charging unit.Unit is surprisingly light weight considering it’s size. Love the backlight options with color, selection choices, etc.",5
962,MSI,"I would definitely purchase another MSI machine I had previously purchased an MSI machine a couple of years ago and was very happy with it, but needed more memory to process some new work applications. Although this new one is not as heavy and solidly built as the previous machine it seems well made none the less. The processing speed has been good, the display is excellent and other than a little hiccup with the sound (I had to purchase a new USB headset because it would not broadcast my audio or voice through my old two plug traditional headset), the computer has performed very well with both work related and gaming applications. I am very pleased and would purchase another MSI machine.",5
963,MSI,"Great vendor I bought this system advertised as used, but I couldn't tell you whether it was or not.It arrived in factory packaging in pristine condition, in beautiful shape, and works fantastically well.One note of caution to other buyers:I upgraded the RAM and the installed HDD to a SATA SSD drive.It was very easy to do.However, you really need to use caution when you take the bottom carriage off.Many of the little clips broke off which help keep the plastic closed.As a result of these breaking off, the plastic and several jacks don't line up as they should.It's not a great design, in my opinion, so be careful when you take it apart.Other than that though, it's great so far.Can't say enough good things about Global CR, from who I ordered this device through Amazon.Responsive and good service.Very, very satisfied.",5

965,MSI,"I would not buy this computer again the computer over all is great but I would not buy this computer again if I had the choice. There is a weird bug that will not let you unpin the dragon center app and the Xbox app from the bottom task bar. if you unpin it, it will repin itself after every restart. it is so annoying that this will probably be my last MSI laptop purchase. there is a fix but you have to spend 100 dollar to get Microsoft pro and then do a bunch of commands to get in to the system to permanently unpin it. its too bad, such a small this ruins this computer completely for me.",1

969,MSI,Handles big games really well. Gets hot after prolonged use.. short battery life The battery life is trash. The game quality handling is goodand it gets hot after extensive use tho it doesn't affect the functions,5
970,MSI,"A great workstation/part time gamer laptop I just bought this a week ago after the back and forth thoughts of “should I buy this or should I avoid it?” after seeing some of the reviews here. Some people say it’s not what comes in the box and that it has different hardware than specified. Maybe they have changed the description since then because I got exactly what is listed, model number, internal hardware and all including the GPU, but like I said, maybe they have edited the details so it’s correct, who knows. Anyway, I moved into this laptop from an XPS L501X from 2011 and still running windows 7 (which I miss already). So far this thing has been a beast for me. I ran a few games, not so much on the heavy graphics side of gaming but more than your average computer can handle. Everything ran flawlessly, CPU temp levels were fantastic, haven’t needed to use the cooler boost but I played with it anyway, it’s not terribly loud but it’s louder than you’d expect. Id say this machine is the perfect balance between what someone needs for an everyday workstation but also has an interest in doing a little gaming here and there. There are just a few things I don’t like and I wouldn’t say they’re “cons”, they’re just things I have to get used to. Having the ports on the sides, especially the power cord is a little odd but it does have a 90 degree elbow so it isn’t sticking out ridiculously far, but having flash drives sticking out near the front of the laptop, just be careful with your hands so that you don’t bump into it and bend or break anything upwards/downwards. The windows key being on the right side but not the left takes some getting used to. The ability to change all the keys light colors to how you want it is pretty great, there’s some presets as well. I usually keep it off but it’s fun to have sometimes. I was nervous about throwing the money down on this and I’ve been an XPS laptop fan for so many years but I’m happier with this laptop than I thought I’d be. Very well packaged and protected. The price is more than fair.",4
971,MSI,Amazing laptop Great laptop!! I love how fast it goes for gaming and my other personal stuff!,5
972,MSI,"Easy to use laptop I got this for a replacement of another MSI laptop and am happy with it.Very fast and responsive with some nice features.RGB keyboard with different layouts or can be turned off (so wife does not complain when I am playing on it at night)Included software is nice and none seems to be what I would call bloatware.The MSI App player lets you play android games and was a bonus feature for me, as I was planning on downloading the software it is based on anyway.Veryquite and so far has not gotten hot like the one it replaced did.Screen is crisp and colors are as they should beAnd the WI-FI is very fast compared to what the old laptop had.",5
973,MSI,"No Complaints As someone who has owned nothing but Dell laptops I didn’t think I would make the switch to MSI. After getting everything setup & getting some use out of it, I must say I made a great choice on buying this entry level gaming laptop. MSI FTW!!!",5
974,MSI,"GOOD LAPTOP A lot of these reviews talk about the low refresh rate and how it’s was advertised to be 144hz. The refresh Rate 60hz, but on valorant I had a solid 300 FPS on high graphic settings. I would read the other reviews before buying but so far the laptop is running great and is built very well, and is VERY PRETTY. This is also my first gaming laptop so I wouldn’t know the best, but if you are looking for a well-built medium price laptop, this is for you. The battery life is pretty bad if you pay on the high performance mode but you can easily change to battery mode or in between both on the MSI Dragon center, or/and from the windows control center.",4
975,MSI,"Hold my PS5. New Keyboard coming through. got this laptop for Fathers Day and I love it! Not sure what issue previous reviewers had but all the specs match the listing, my wife and son picked good with this one!super easy setup process out of the box with a couple of updates needed but had no issues with that. 60hz refresh rate so we’ll see how that impacts my game play. not doing anything too crazy so I assume it’ll be fine.looked into more of MSI’s laptops after setting this one up and im already adding one of their bigger gaming units to my Christmas list!",5
976,MSI,Nice Gaming Laptop My friends told me MSI is big in the PC gaming space. I needed to get a gaming laptop that will work well for the family. I settled on this one because 512GB and 16GB of RAM. The video card is GTX 1650 and from what my friends tell me its good enough to play games on.,5
977,MSI,Item may have a random automatic sleep issue that is unresolved I bought this for my main laptop replacement for professional photo/video/audio editing/rendering as well as architectural 3d modeling. Before updates it runs everything I need it to without a hiccup.After updates it lags pretty much every change made in an average 3D modeling project. Idling up to a minute.The batter life actually does ok for being a Beast. Overall a great work laptop with an easy on the eyes screen and plethora of features. Mine however came with the random sleep problem msi seems to not have resolved. It may be an uncommon flaw but I had to return it. Come to find out the M1 chip is actually more capable and the pro battery lasts 20 hours so check those out if haven't and are looking for a work laptop.,3
978,MSI,GRan equipo para juegos PAntalla excelente al igual que la gpu duaracion de la bateria muy escasa pero bien para un equipo de esta gama,5
979,MSI,"Dope deal It's great for the price the backlight screen bleeding is a small issue (I use a monitor) but it is probably the only con, this thing is sleek and as long as you lower the cpu frequency and use msi after burner you can run the fans low at 75ish degrees, with little to no frame drop. Oh battery life isn't great but mines always plugged in. So my review is catered to my application of the pc.",5
980,MSI,"Great laptop, love the Hard Drive options Long story short, fast forward to the end.....My Asus Vivobook Pro took a dump. Had two hard drives in the Asus, one was a M.2 and the other was a 2.5"". I did not want to start over, installing apps again, and I did not want to lose my 2.5 or M.2.MSI solved all my problems.It comes with one 2.5"" bay and TWO M.2/NVME PCIe combo drive bays!!!So not only did my two drives transfer over seamlessly, but Windows 11 automatically updated most of the drivers upon first boot.I also transferred over my 32GB DDR4-2400 ram and works great as well.Up and running within 20 minutes.

Boxing: 3 boxes (1 Amazon + 2 MSI).Windows 10 Pro installed.This is my first gaming laptop, I used to have destkop gaming, the display that uses in Windows is the integrated video and I don't know if I can switch to use the RTX dedicated video card.

985,MSI,"Incredible graphics People use their laptops for different purposes, so I'll state mine right away. I write novels, I watch movies, and I edit film montages. I do not play games, nor do I use multiple programs at a time for work.So, for my purposes, this Dell XPS laptop is fantastic. You'll have to see it to believe how tiny and thin it is, which could be a pro or con depending on your point of view. Pro is it's easily transported, either around the house or traveling. Con is if you are watching a movie, it's a small screen. The keyboard is easy to use, and the touchpad is large. I'm still getting used to the touch screen, as it's very foreign to me. But then again, I'm also still getting used to the automatically installed Alexa and fingerprint scanning on/off button. Times are changing.As two of my three primary uses involves graphics, I'm extremely pleased. When I'm editing, I can really see the detail and there are no 'freeze ups' as my older computer would have. Movies seem like they're in high definition. The contrast in colors, (or if you pop in an old black-and-white noir) is really intense.As always, know what you're looking for in a laptop. If you're primary motivation is RAM, speed, graphics, size, etc, then look up what will be best for you. I'm a huge fan of Dell computers, and I expect this one to last as long as my last one (five years, and it didn't really die, I was just ready for an upgrade). The battery life is great, and even though the cords look a little weird in the box, you'll figure it out. My biggest con is the lack of ports, namely USB and HDMI, but you can't have everything. This is perfect for the traveler. Charge it up, watch a great movie on the airplane, and it won't weigh down or take up much room in your carry-on bag.",5
986,MSI,"Overrated Ended up sending it back. Runs super hot, good luck if you try to use it on your belly while laying in bed like me!Not as fast as expected even with the Intel 11th gen and 16GB of Ram, especially when you factor in the price...",3
987,MSI,"Beast of a travel laptop! At this screen size, which is just a bit larger than the premium tablets from Apple and Samsung, this is a laptop designed for travel.Because of the metal body it is not as light as some other laptops of similar size, but the build quality feels so much better.I absolutely love that they didn't scrimp on the hard drive and gave you a decent size.With an i7 processor and 16GB of RAM this laptop can handle audio and video processing while doing standard business and casual work at the same time.This is a premium laptop (at a premium price) designed to do serious heavy lifting, but I do wonder that all this power is in a laptop that is this size and obviously geared toward business travelers -- unless it's just for executives that want to have the latest and greatest for their PowerPoint presentations.Still, attached to a docking station with a large monitor, this will power through work and play.I've had no issues with the WiFi at all and this is only connected via WiFi in my setup.Dell is often thought of as the ""worker bee"" laptop company, but this laptop is more for queen bees.Very, very impressed.",5

989,MSI,"Lightweight & great sound & color make this a nice computer... This teeny, tiny computer is so thin & lightweight, it practically fits in a manila envelope. I was able to get it set up fairly easily. I’m switching from a laptop that uses a touchpad or mouse & this has a touch screen. I’m going back & forth between computers to get everything set up & I prefer a mouse over a touchpad. Such a simple thing but it sure wastes time when you forget which device uses which.But on to this really nice Dell laptop. First, this thing is so lightweight. I always travel with my laptop & flying with this one that’s easy to slip into a slightly oversized purse & is extremely lightweight has improved traveling for me.The speakers have a nice clear sound so it was a winner in my book. I can’t always hear things very well & actually have a new flatscreen I’m ready to pitch out the door because it sounds like mush. No one else has that problem with it so I think it’s me but that doesn’t make me able to hear it any better. I hear everything just fine with this computer. I really enjoy that.I like the back lighting that makes it easy to use in a dark room. I don’t have a glare with this computer.Probably the best part for me is the OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diodes) that emit their own light when an electric current is passed through rather than having an external light source for brightness. The resulting colors are vibrant & crisp; good for watching things like YouTube & Netflix or Skyping & photoshopping. I can be doing what I want, watching what I want & I’m not disturbing anyone else in the room. I’m enjoying darker darks, lighter lights, brighter colors & have an excellent viewing experience. I didn’t realize what I was missing until I started watching it on this computer.It’s expensive to have that technology but this computer will last for years. It has a crazy long lifespan, the battery lasts around 6 hours before needing charged. I’m not a technology genius; all I can say is what I like & I like this computer. It’s tempting to get new games to see how much the graphics improve but I don’t need to do that. My husband, though, is very excited to use this computer for flight programs. I told him I’d think about it.",4

994,MSI,"everything good but beware OLED display Yes, this is a wonderful laptop and the display is stunning. But what Dell and OLED TV sellers won't tell you about is the unspoken pitfalls of OLED technology. Yes, they do provide the clearest, most stunning display of any screen technology. What they don't warn you about is after approximately 10k hours of use the OLED technology will result in irreversible burn-in, especially if any image, particularly red or green, is left static on the screen repeatedly. Since most laptop users keep their laptops on, or default to their desktops for extended periods, or are working spreadsheets for hours on end, or are using them for extended periods of time with the same parts of the screen remaining static for extended periods of time, a burn it will invariably result. It won't MIGHT happen...it WILL happen. This burn in is not correctable...the entire display needs to be replaced. For instance, if you use Facebook a lot and there are red dots on any of the icons on top of the page, and you don't click on them, it will result in a burn-in after an extended exposure. I have dealt with this twice on my LG 55"" OLED 4k SMART television. I enjoyed the best looking TV screen for approximately 10k hours of use and then POW...overnight I started seeing burn in from the ""Breaking News"" banners from CNN and from other programs which I watched all the time that had static images, such as their station logo in one of the corners; or if I had one of the TV's HDMI inputs set to my computer and I left the desktop on all the time with no screen saver activated. Luckily for me, my 5-year warranty protected me, but the same thing happened all over again. Since I also used my LG OLED 4k Smart TV as my computer monitor, I installed a screen saver on my computer that activates after 30 seconds so there is never the possibility of a burn in in case I accidently leave an image on the TV when it is displaying anything static from my computer. Any time I pause a TV program I am watching, I immediately switch the HDMI input to my computer and the screen saver kicks on in under 30 seconds as long as I don't move the mouse....hence no static image, which means no burn in. This is why OLED screens are not recommended for computer use, but are terrific for TV use PROVIDED YOU HAVE A COMPUTER WITH AN ACTIVATED 30-SECOND SCREEN SAVER ATTACHED THROUGH ONE OF THE TV'S HDMI INPUTS. My computer is still attached to my OLED TV. but when I use it now, I never go to a website that keeps a static image; I always have my 30-second screen saver activated; and I never leave the desktop static on my computer. Until the manufacturers solve the burn-in issues of OLED technology, it is safer to use QLED technology when it becomes available for laptops and computer monitors. OLED...great for TV's....not safe for computers yet.",3

It has a fantastic graphics card.It’s a little heavier than I like but if you are mostly staying in one place, don’t hesitate to choose this computer.",5
1011,MSI,"Great Laptop! Great value! Fantastic service! This laptop has upgraded specs installed by Computer Upgrade King (CUK).I will be using it for email, household management, general web surfing, video games, YouTube, and streaming movies and TV.This is the third laptop that I have purchased from CUK.The first had a manufacturing design defect.The second died from an accidental bath!The laptop has a fantastic screen.The image is crisp and clear, virtually no flickering.A picture taken of the screen with my phone is extremely close to a screenshot!The keyboard has a very comfortable touch and feel.It is very quiet.Many options for keyboard lighting are available via a button on the right hand side.Options include motion as well as static and 'off'.Another button on the right side controls internal fans for additional cooling when needed. This option is either on or off.I tend to keep the laptop plugged in, only running the battery down to 10% occasionally.I have chosen the ""best for battery life"" in the settings.All the stellar specs mean nothing when you need service on the laptop if good service is not available.CUK branded products are give a three year warranty through CUK.This is an outstanding warranty.I have contacted CUK with things as mundane as where can I get basic software for something that was accidently deleted to needing a motherboard replaced.In every instance, service was excellent, fair and prompt.Every interaction I have had with the CUK techs has been superior.CUK techs are experts.I have described issues and they have offered solutions that are correct and work the first time.I recommend any CUK branded product because CUK stands behind it's work.",5

1016,MSI,"The confusion about the NVidia 1650TI vs the 1650. This is just for information.I have a friend who bought this PC. Here are a few points for you ""Non-Technical"" people. Firstly, if you do your research, the 1650TI or 1660TI are not better cards vs the regular 1650 and 1660. So if you have the 1650 without the TI label, you're better off. Secondly, most promises for frames are going to be misguided promises. Why is that? Because many of you don't get to know the settings for the games that they are describing. Are they turning off shadows? Are they not using the enhancements? Even when I use the enhancements in the games on a RTX card the 3060, frames can be driven down to 50fps and worse.The settings of course in many games can be maxed, but for some games, unless you have chosen many proper values, you're going to drop frames regardless. So do your homework, I am only giving this a rating based on my friend who I suggested to buy this PC. I am a very active customer here and also, I only use computers from xotic pc or HP.Most computers are built with the economy customer in mind. If you really want the best, it has to be custom ordered.Pre-made factory PCs will always come with advantages and disadvantages.I'd advise everyone to not only read a few reviews, but try to find stress tests to see how much any computer can take. If you can't find this information, then YOU are the new tester and you have to do your own R&A and almost never take a review seriously unless they have a history of valuable reviews.I don't usually leave reviews unless they are 5 star because I am not into drawing the negatives unless by far, the description lies to the point of deception.It's very hard to rate a computer with 5 stars. There will almost indefinitely be something that doesn't satisfy us if we are not able to customize it to our taste.This computer did run well once properly configured and tested against the ""words of others"" who are not actual tech-minded people and therefore can only base the review off the expectations that they had.Also, many people will almost always upgrade a laptop because it almost always performs better after the upgrade.That could be the RAM, the SSD -- being that almost all PCs do not come with the fastest speed SSD or even a gaming SSD.The point of this message is to let you who are not so tech savvy understand that it is easier to buy a laptop if you have expendable money. It's very rare that I will buy a Laptop and leave it as is.I hope this helps those who are disappointed.If you ever need to, look for videos that address the issues that I am reading here.I do offer assistance at times. DexterMeadors on IG. I am an not condoning bad salesmanship but my main reason for writing is to address the complaint about not getting the TI version of a card. The TI version of a card can be inferior and many do not know that.",4
1017,MSI,"SIMPLEMENTE HERMOSA Excelente laptop, podríamos decir que el único punto débil es su batería (pero creo que es normal en este tipo de laptops gaming). pero por lo demás hasta ahora sin problemas, rápida, diseño muy elegante, y ya se instaló windows 11 sin problemas...",5
1018,MSI,"Not the best laptop for the price, also has seller issues First off, the seller and general overall purchase process was pretty bad. This is labeled as including a 1650ti, after using nvidia inspector and nvidia geforce, dxdiag and cpu-z I can confirm what I received only has a 1650. I spoke with amazon who gave me a promotional balance and also reported the seller for good reason. So beware, and ensure you receive what you paid for!The laptop itself leaves much to be desired for it's $800 price tag and even though I'm just using it for daily leisurely computing I can't imagine using this at a decent frame-rate and quality with any current gen games as mentioned by others. My daily desktop rig has a ryzen 9 3900x and a 2080ti so this is going to be used as a general mobile computing laptop for watching movies and such so it's gaming performance isn't a focus for me. I ordered some crucial RAM and upgraded it to 24gb and it runs plenty fast as expected. I'm also coming from more expensive rigs so this is me being pretty critical for it's bang for the buck. Here are some Pros but everything has caveats given it's price:1. Relatively solid build quality for daily use given it's price tag. Back panel however is cheaply made and a little difficult to remove to install ram or an ssd upgrade.2. High refresh rate display and resolution (will get to it's brightness issues later)3. Decent speeds with an nvme, discrete graphics but requires RAM to be upgraded to at least 16gb4. Can upgrade and add a 2.5 inch ssd, new nvme, more ram (with some caveats)5. Decent value if you ignore these caveats and it doesn't bother youCons:1. Low amount of RAM stock, the GPU for the intel graphics and nvidia graphics need to tap into ram for shared memory at times if you are gaming hard, this means that 8gb of RAM will never be enough with OS overhead, therfore you need to throw around $70+2. Singular back panel that's difficult to get off to upgrade the RAM, you need to use a fixit pry tool to safely remove it, which in my experience risks breaking plastic clips, getting it back on is also annoyingly difficult. Not that difficult for them to have added separate panels above the nvme slots and ram slots which are the two most common things to swap out.3. NVME ssd is a kioxia brand not a name brand, but that's kind of alright given they had to save cost, it lacks a bit in throughput but can be upgraded to say a 970evo, which will have around 30%-40% better overall performance4. The display seems to be on the lower end of brightness nits and colors can seem a little washed out, the resolution and refresh rate is great, but it's very clearly a cheaper panel.5. Windows 10 home instead of Pro, this is a nitpick but working in IT, alot of the management features are missing in win10 home instead of pro, it's a $99 upgrade if you don't use other sources to upgrade the key.So all in all, if I were to do it all over again, I'd say maybe save your money and go upmarket if you actually want a true ""gaming"" laptop. This design and specs overall leave a lot to be desired, thecpu is high clock speed but lacks cores, the nvme isn't the best and the ram is lacking which you will need to upgrade anyway with an ssd which puts this at around $1k at that point. Also you don't want to have to open the back of this thing repeatedly as it definitely feels as though it's going to break the back panel.User be warned, check your order and thoroughly plan out your purchase with this one.",3

You can remove and install RAM.There is also a SSD slot available.The current M.2 drive is removable as well so you may upgrade!The cooling pipes are very nice ( I have opened the back of the laptop ).There are plenty of videos on upgrading memory in this MSI laptop on Y..tube.You must look for yourself... seek and you will find!Compare videos of teardown of other brands with better stats perhaps, it is something to consider.I play a game with two accounts at the same time and it gets reasonable warm on the top left, but this is what heatpipes and venting do. Perfectly normal.This is MSI. A company that makes motherboards.So don't hold back when you wish it had more RAM or higher SSD size, because as you go you can upgrade!..suprizingly while I game, I am not maxing RAM!If you want a higher end laptop, make sure you look for one with the cooling system this has, and way out the cost... you can always lower game settings. This is not a 4k gaming laptop and therefore you won't be paying $3,000 +.I have a ryzen 5600x gaming desktop that I am now going to sell because of this beautiful display, lit keyboard, and the price, with the cooling system and upgradability. The mobility wins on my decision.Battery life is as expected for a 17"" display and dedicated GPU.Laptops never get fantastic battery life!The only thing to consider is, 17 inch. Can you put up with the size of a beautiful display? or perhaps go smaller...Of coarse I wish this was oled, 3080 with atleast 5600X cpu but it isn't.. Don't compare that , you are in the wrong section and price. Besides, you would get 20 minutes of battery life if it was!I am going to get another 8gb stick of ram for a total 16gb, maybe even buy a kit of 16gb. I will possibly buy a 1tb M.2 for this, but I'm no where near filling up this 512.. I wasn't on my gaming laptop either that has a 980 pro. M.2.Going to sell my mini itx pc, make twice the $ and be happy with this laptop.Thank you for readin!ps. you can't find any graphics cards now, think about that. (although I have one in my PC).",5
1023,MSI,Dont buy this for gaming. Before I bought this I did some research on how many fps in valorant using this gpu and cpu. Mostof them show 140+ on high settings but Im only getting 55 to 65 fps on low settings.The first time I turned it on the cpu was burning and usage was at 100% but I only had chrome opened.IT'S USELESS,1
1024,MSI,Awesome gaming laptop I love this laptop. Bought it to use as a desktop equivalent as I am a gamer. I have MD and can not always sit at my desk top game. Bought this to use when I want to relax in chair. Works wonderfully!!! I would suggest using headphones as fans get a little loud when gaming but they keep they machine cool. I use headphones to talk with friends so not an issue. I would suggest also using a lap table so it sits on a hard flat surface instead of on legs as it needs ventilation and on legs holes get blocked and it runs hotter.,5

1035,MSI,"Good laptop after some tweaking I got this laptop a few days ago and have tested it for nearly 48h.Some things to consider• Pretty good screen for a laptop. 144hz and good looking out of the box• Laptop frame feels solid but isnt overly heavy.• The 6gb RTX 3060 runs games really well. Division 2 averaged over 120 fps at max settings at 1080p. I tested war thunder, escape from tarkov andmordhau as well and both were extremely smooth (both hit 144hz reliably at ultra 1080p). No noticable input or screen lag in mordhau so fast shooterswill benefit as well.• No noticeable micro stutters when switching from• The laptop top doesn’t feel hot under pressure but I wouldn’t play this on my lap.• I added a 1tb WD Blue NVMe stick to this laptop, its easy to do and there are videos of how to do it.• The GPU runs cool for a laptop (avg 78 under pressure) but the CPU doesn’t. You can fix this by limiting the max power in power settings for the CPU or undervolting it. The cpu has initial spikes in temp but usually ends up in the mid 80s which is a little hot but expected.• Use dragon center to tune the performance. Don’t run extreme performance without cooler boost.• Buy a cooling pad and watch temps for the CPU, the CPU is the only thing that holds this beast back because it tends to hit high temps (95c max from what I saw) if left at max settings.• It has 2x USB3.2and 2x USB-C so you might need to buy an usb dongle. It has a single jack for a headset so you might need to buy a splitter depending on your headset.• One HDMI only. No displayport at all which is something to consider. The HDMI is capable of 4k 60hz but at the end of the day its HDMI. Should be compatible with g sync or g sync supported monitors.",5
1036,MSI,"Could be better The Build quality is good but some useful features are missing and the performance isn't as good as expected for the price paid.Pros:- Good build quality- The Fans are smooth even when spinning fast, no high pitched whining noise.- Very responsive in web browsing and other various programs- High refresh rate screen- The RTX 3060 is cooled well even under heavy loads- MSI still lets you undervolt the 10th gen Intel CPU's- Good built in audio DACThings I didn't like:- The Intel 10th gen i7, I'm not a fan of the higher end 10th gen Intel chips, they like to run hot and throttle down often which means your not getting all of the performance advertised. Too much tweaking such as undervolting is needed to make them only a little bit better.- No thunderbolt, it didn't keep me from buying but it seems a little odd to not have it when there are two USB C ports.- The RTX 3060 is capped at 75W so it's a max Q, it still does ok but I would have liked a higher watt version.Perhaps the CPU MSI picked and the heat it generates made this not possible.- The screen isn't very colorful- No SD card slotOverall I'd look at other laptops using a Ryzen or newer Intel CPU when paired with an RTX 3000 graphics card.",3

1043,MSI,"Good performance laptop. It works very well, overall, and is so much faster than my 10 year old Toshiba A4 processor laptop, which this replaced.The screen quality is fantastic. Be aware that this laptop does run hot for extended file transfers and for gaming. Purchase of a generic cooling pad mitigates the heating issue for gaming, especially when coupled with system changes: throttling the max CPU load to 95%, capping the FPS to 60fps and manually setting the onboard RTX2060 to be the default graphics adaptor within the Nvidia Control Panel.It plays a lot of AAA games well: Dying Light, Metro Last Light, Borderlands 3, all run way better than expected, if not perfectly.

1054,MSI,"i waited over a year to review this and im still not sure how i feel about it quick disclaimer: i don't know very much about computers and this is the first 'gaming' computer i've ever had. this is all just personal experiences and probably not a lot of tech savvy jargon. i'll try and sprinkle some where i can, though.my previous computer was an hp pavillion, one of the ones that you could fully flip around and use as a tablet.i had some serious fan and overheating issues at the end of it's life and eventually the cpu sputtered out. something else happened that Geek Squad couldn't help me with unless i spent several hundred more dollars than i was comfortable with. so i gave up on it after a long process of backing it up while it shut down on me every 10 minutes.i decided to save up for something that i could use for more than just school, the sims 3, and art.bought the MSI GF75 around early september last year after looking around for a while. it had high reviews and was within my self-assigned price range. i actually found it at fry's electronics before buying it off of amazoni liked the size and weight of it, the nvidia graphics card didn't mean anything to me until really recently. the underside of it is basically a vent (i had a very sophisticated setup of books, icepacks, a handheld fan, and tiled bathroom floors for summertime computer usage)basically, it had a lot of stuff i liked, was a good price and had great reviews for more than 5 pages of google.maybe i missed some, i don't know.but i've had constant problems with my CPU going from 33°C to 70°C in under a minute if i have google chrome and discord open simultaneously.sometimes dragon center (system monitoring thing that lets you adjust settings and such) would reset my fan speed settings so my computer would be at 90°C and only one of my cooling fans would be at 1500 Rotations Per Minute.this is a constant problem i have with the discord+chrome combo by the way. i don't have both applications open simultaneously anymore.i don't really have this issue while playing games though, which is...great? at least, i've never reached 90°C CPU temperature while playing MMO's for several hours.so, discord and chrome at the same time? 5 minutes or more until i hit at least 75°Capex legends with all the textures and particle effects and graphics as pretty as a peach? 3 hours before i hit 60°C after having a steady 40°Calso, whatever material the case of the laptop is made from? it catches fingerprints like a forensic scientists wet dream. i have no idea how to clean it properly and have just done my best to make peace with whatever i can't wipe away with a microfiber cloth.i haven't made much progress with the peace making even after a year.so this is a good gaming laptop, has a lot of features that i like (dragon force IS extremely handy)i haven't encountered any issues other than these couple and they're annoying but livable.i'm either going to sell this laptop so i can have my best friend build me a pc or im going to have someone clean the exterior and try and find the equivalent of a macbook case for it.",3

1056,MSI,"Really great laptop for the price but... I’ll start off saying that this laptop is an absolute beast. Loading web pages is near instant and extremely satisfying to click on something and it to immediately open. Gaming is phenominal too, I can run GTA 5 on max settings right at 60fps (I turn it down a bit to be nicer to the laptop though as it gets hot, which I’ll talk about in a bit). CSGO I can get almost 300fps which I limit to 120 usually. Basically, if you want to play games this is the laptop to get. However it gets extremely hot. Even on cooler boost the cpu and gpu will hit over 80°C and be almost unbearable to touch near the top keys. It also has started to get a weird metallic smell which makes me nauseous to the point where I have to shut the laptop off and open my window to vent the room. I don’t know if it’s normal or not but after reading around online I wonder if the smell is toxic because of the symptoms I have from it. I don’t know if it’s just a problem with mine or not but basically I would stay away if you don’t have a laptop cooler pad or something to keep it a bit cooler, as I’ve started to get sick when playing on it. Other than that it’s a fantastic machine and I don’t regret buying it at all!",4

The more I learn about this laptop by using it, the more I am adamantly in love with it and my trust for Amazon and their products only grows.",5
1077,Microsoft,Awesome technology. Love it. It's perfect in size and capacity.,5
1078,Microsoft,"Laptop will not run Zoom meetings, Google Chrome or Microsoft updated browser I purchased this in order to attend Zoom meetings. The laptop downloads but does not open or run programs. The various how-to's on Youtube etc. are not effective in overcoming this deficiency. Please be advised: This seller will charge from 20 to 50% of the purchase price for ""restocking"" plus an additional twenty dollars postage and handling. Oops!Note to self: Check seller return policy before making purchase.",1
1079,Microsoft,Excellent customer service The laptop I received had some technical issues but it was promptly replaced. My grandson uses this for his online Zoom college classes and could not be happier with it. The touch screen is a huge plus and the weight & size are perfect to transport to and from class.I highly recommend Micro Direct Deals for your laptop needs.,5
1080,Microsoft,"Battery life is junk I have owned this laptop for three months with very light usage. About two weeks ago the battery life became shorter and shorter. Now if it's not plugged in all the time the battery goes from 100% to 0 just sitting there, not being used, in other words turned ""off"". WTF! Before this started happening when it was plugged in charging it would become seriously ""hot"" just sitting on the table top. All that being said, this laptop that I spent over $1000.00 on will be going back to Best Buy. Very disappointed.",1
1081,Microsoft,"Great computer...for 2 months only! I am completely appalled at the poor quality of the physical body of the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 4. After much deliberation between the Laptop 4 vs MacBook Air, my husband and I decided on the Laptop 4. BIGGEST MISTAKE in product choice and now customer service experience. No dropping, no trauma to the computer. One minute, it's perfect. In its closed state, the laptop was tapped to point it out for someone to it. The next minute, the computer is opened to a cracked and shattered screen. We purchased this just over 2 months ago, and Microsoft Customer Service is telling me I need to pay $499 for a replacement with a refurbished computer, even though the site states that is when we damaged it ourselves. Despite explaining that we did not cause trauma to the Laptop to result in such a broken screen, the customer service agent basically called me a liar because ""there is no way a screen would have cracked like that without trauma."" In the end, he said to go ahead and leave a review and hung up on me. I will NEVER purchase a Microsoft product again and will be letting everyone I know to avoid them and to buy Apple or any other product. My MacBook Air has been thrown around for work and I've had NO issue for about 10 years. I've had other brands of laptops that withstood much abuse. I can't believe we thought this Laptop could be a portable device as it is apparently meant to be gently fixed in position without touching it. But more anger provoking than the broken new device is the poor, rude, unwilling to help, and offensive customer service. Never again.",1
1082,Microsoft,"Excellent Tuochpad and Keyboard Unparalleled feeling trackpad and keyboard for a windows device. It is the closest thing to a Mac running windows. If you are looking for the best feeling keyboard and trackpad, this is it. Beautiful screen although it is quite reflective.",5
1083,Microsoft,"I had the Surface Laptop 3 (AMD and Intel) and now I have the 4..... three good improvements! The three things that were improved include the processor, battery life, and WiFi reconnection. As a computer nerd, all of these made a difference to me! If you don't like the auto brightness/contrast display adjustment, get Intel and not AMD.The exterior of the Surface Laptop 4 is unchanged. You get the same screen, keyboard, and case. But why would anybody complain when they were already great? The screen has perfect 3x2 dimensions which is better than 16x10 and 16x9 in terms of productivity. It has great colors unless you are an extreme graphic artist who needs the best accuracy - most people don't. The glossy display helps with the vivid colors but does add noticeable glare which is inherent to glass. I welcome the tradeoff and don't mind angling the laptop if there's more glare than I want. Sure, the Surface has big bezels but I got over that. The keyboard is top-notch. This was one of the biggest selling points as I type a lot and can type fast (120wpm). The only better laptop keyboard in my lifetime was the Dell XPS 9310's. I recently used a Dell XPS 9510 and really didn't like the mushy and unresponsive keyboard. I also had Lenovo X1 Carbons for years so I appreciate good keyboards. But let's be real: most of you are slow typers so most keyboards will do the trick. Note: the matte black Surface Laptops have a different feeling keyboard! Definitely check that out at Best Buy or Costco before purchasing. I type faster with the non-black version.So what did change? The Surface Laptop 4 now has a better 11th gen processor whereas the 3 had the Intel 10th gen processor. The 11th gen has better graphics capability and processing power. I only watch YouTube videos and there's less performance lag with this, but it's not much. Maybe some programs open up a little faster but I only use my laptop to do web-based and light Office work. Most people won't notice that much of a difference. But, long-term, the 11th gen is a better investment than the 10th gen. Battery life is good on the 4! I had the 15"" 3 and currently have a 13.5"" 4 so keep that in mind. I am not comparing apples to apples. My 15"" 3 had subpar battery life. My 13.5"" 4 gets good battery life. You won't get 19 hours (that's preposterous!) like Microsoft said - heck, if I get a third of that on a full charge, I'd be happy. Another improvement is the wifi connection upon waking up the computer from sleep. The 3 had a wifi power conservation issue. It put the wifi antennas in low-power mode so it took about 15 seconds for you to regain internet access when you lifted the lid up. Annoying! Now it's more like five seconds which is much more bearable. Thank you! I'm glad enough people complained for Microsoft to do something about this.So how's the value? Not great. I purchased the 13.5"" because the 15"" is so overpriced that it's criminal. I would prefer the bigger screen but I'm not paying that much more. I got my machine from Best Buy as an open-box item so I saved a few hundred dollars off the regular price. Microsoft's pricing is pretty silly and I don't like that at all - but what's new? For the casual user (I use my laptop for web-based work mostly), 8GB of memory is enough if you only use your laptop for the internet and some programs. If you are editing video and images, running VMs, etc., you're probably not getting a Surface Laptop. I could care less about the hard drive size as I have flash/external drives. Why pay hundreds more for internal space?? But the screen and keyboard may justify the higher price. I truly value these two aspects. I know Microsoft overcharges but I can't avoid it. I'll think about upgrading to the 15"" but the 13.5"" works for me now. With both of these, remember to scale up the text size (I do 175%) unless you have amazing vision and want to see more text on your screen.One more choice you'll need to make is getting Intel or AMD. I can't use AMD laptops because of the inability to turn off the auto brightness/contrast option. This is when the screen dims when you are looking at something darker in order to save battery power. This is so annoying to me. With Intel, you can download Intel Graphics Command Center and turn off the power-saving features. I couldn't do this with the AMD Surface so I returned my 3 that had this processor. I don't know if the AMD version is faster or has battery life but I don't care. The adaptive brightness/contrast thing is a deal breaker for me.I really don't need to mention this but the Surface Laptop 4 still looks great compared to other laptops. The sandstone color is beautiful and everything just looks nice. If you go for the 15"" model, you only get black and silver options.People complain about the lack of ports but it works fine for me. I connect my phone and flash drive to this and one USB-C port is sufficient. I also have a wireless mouse that uses a USB-A dongle. I'm glad this laptop still has one of those - my Dell XPSes only had USB-C connections.Microsoft still uses its proprietary tube-like charger. It works fine and I'm not complaining. I also used a USB-C charger and it works fine.",4
1084,Microsoft,"Microsoft comes through ad a Winner! Purchased for our grandson on starting college in August. It was an immediate hit for him. Plus Microsoft protected it with exceptional packing, This saved the laptop from being destroyed by the careless packing by the shipper. Every corner of the Microsoft box was dented or crushed. There was no protective badding at all to stop the laptop box from banging around in the flimsy shipper box. What an outstanding job Microsoft. Fire your shipper. This company should be punished!",5
1085,Microsoft,"Arrived on time and worked like a charm right out of the box Purchased as a replacement for old Surface with a broken screen. I could be wrong, but it was hard to find a Surface Laptop 4 on short notice and this one seems to have fit the bill.",5
1086,Microsoft,"Touch screen BUT NOT convertible to tablet Very sleek.The black exterior is very nice.It looks very modern and clean.It could look cleaner if the thickness was uniform across the laptop.At its thinnest part it's noticeably thinner than my Mac Book Pro 2019.At it's thickest it's not noticeably thicker than my Mac Book Pro 2019.The touch screen is nice.It comes in useful occasionally.However, the laptop's touch screen could have been much more useful if the touch screen could be folded all the way back into a tablet.Right now, drawing or doing anything extensive with the touch screen isn't as easy since the screen doesn't fold flat.Also, it would have been great if a stylus was provided with the laptop.Using your fingers works just fine, but not being able to use the laptop as a writing or drawing surface is a missed opportunity.I feel like without being able to use it flat like a tablet, I would rather pay less and not include the touch screen.The touchpad is very nice.I would say it's on par with the Mac Book Pro's touch pad.It's very soft, responsive and easy to use.It has a louder, more noticeable click feeling and sound than my Mac Book Pro's touch pad.It doesn't have a fingerprint reader, but it does use face detection to unlock.The face detection is very fast and easier to use than a fingerprint reader.I don't miss the fingerprint reader at all.The keyboard is the standard chiclet style keys.They work just fine and has a dimmable back light.The power adapter provided works and charges the laptop just fine.It is magnetic so you don't have to worry about breaking the laptop if you trip over the cable.However, I think it would have been great if it was a USB-C power adapter.I was able to charge the laptop with my Mac Book Pro's USB-C charger.I would have loved the flexibility of having another USB-C port for charging instead of it's dedicated non-USB-C charging port.The laptop does have one USB-A and one USB-C port.Having a USB-A port is getting less common, but it's convenient that this laptop comes with one.You may need to get a dongle if you want to use two USB-A devices (likely a mouse and keyboard). There's also no HDMI out, but there is a dongle.If you wanted to use a second monitor, you'd need a dongle for that as well.I think dongles are pretty common these days especially to keep the laptop compact.Overall, I think it's a great laptop.There are some improvements that could really make this laptop shine: - Letting the screen fold flat for a tablet mode - Include a stylus pen - Replace the charging port with USB-C charging",4
1087,Microsoft,"A premium laptop with unique features that may make it worth the price Overview:TL;DR: The Surface Laptop 4 paints a great photo of how Microsoft is capable of building a solid machine. The unique design of a 3:2 display is a welcome one that I feel many people will appreciate when using it in the real world. The build quality is exceptional, and while the device isn't the most repairable product on the market, Microsoft has gone through some lengths to help serviceability. The real trade-off is that the unique design means lower performance per dollar compared to the competition and lack of ports. Overall, it's a good laptop if you want a premium product with the Surface name and don't mind the few limitations of the device.Performance:The model reviewed here has the i5-1135G7, which is the lowest end variant of this unit, but if you haven't upgraded a computer in the past few years you will be shocked at the performance of mobile processors. The i5 is a quad-core processor with hyperthreading, giving it 8 threads for work tasks. In most cases, the i5 will be more than suitable enough for even more demanding tasks like rendering on Adobe products.The limiting factor, for some, may be the 8 gigabytes of ram that isn't upgradable. The ram allows the computer to store information on much faster storage space for really quick access, so if that small ram amount fills up that information goes to the larger, albeit much slower in comparison, hard drive. Again, for most who will use this for simple work tasks and browsing the web, you'll never have an issue. I however often go over 8Gb on Chrome on my workstation alone, so this wouldn't be a suitable on-the-go solution for me. So, in my opinion, if you are doing general web browsing and office tasks, 8 gigabytes will be fine, however, I'd recommend 16 if you can afford it as you won't be able to change it in the future.The extra power of the i5 doesn't come at the cost of short battery life, I was easily able to get 7-8 hours on a more demanding day and could easily squeeze 10 hours of constant usage with lower brightness and eco-mode. In my research, the Surface Laptop isn't best in class for battery, but it is a huge upgrade for those with 3-4-year-old laptops and is better than average for this generation.Ports:I think the Surface Laptop 4 comes with the bare minimum for ports, in fact, a bit less. You will get the following:1 x USB-A (Think most USB devices, ie a Thumb drive, mouse, etc)1 x USB-C (Think newer USB devices, ie a Phone, Dock connector, charging the laptop, etc)1 x 3.5mm (headphones / Mic)1 x Surface Magnetic Proprietary chargerUSB-C in this case is not ThunderBolt capable, which is a real shame at this price point. You can still dock the Surface Laptop 4 on a dock with USB C, but ThunderBolt capabilities will be limited, which limits accessories like a graphics dock.The Surface Magnetic charger is very similar to Apple Magsafe, which allowed you to charge the laptop and if the cable were to be moved the laptop would stay. I use my Surface charger constantly as it's far easier to plug in and gives me a safe of mind when using it in public. Do note that USB-C charging is supported, so if you lose the Surface charger, you can easily buy a USB-C charger for this laptop and other USB-C devices.Ultimately, it is fine for what it is and you see more ports on more value-based laptops, it's just a shame we only get 1 of each.Build Quality / Repairability / Upgradability:The Surface Laptop 4 is easily one of the most premium products I've held in my hand, it feels clean, compact, and sturdy. If you have any concern with the build quality, then hopefully I can put some ease that Microsoft didn't skimp on material.Now, this may be a huge purchase for some and repairability is something I take into account when reviewing a laptop - it's how I kept my first laptop alive for many years. Compared to their first versions of the Surface Laptop, it looks like the keyboard and storage are upgradable which is a huge plus. There are replaceable parts and the battery can be done. Understandably, with a unique display, you may be better off going to Microsoft for a quality unit if it breaks, but it is possible to replace it.Keyboard / Trackpad:I've read some complaints with flex on this keyboard, while this is true I didn't find it annoying in any way. I spent my college years typing on an X220 and understand that the keyboard is an important aspect when buying a laptop, the comfortable alcantara rest makes it comfortable to use - however, this fabric has been known to get discoloured after time. Thankfully, the keyboard can be replaced in the future if it becomes a problem (but definitely worth noting).The trackpad is a joy to use with all gestures 'just working' out of the box. There isn't much to comment here as it works fine and it never feels like a hassle to use.Webcam / Microphone:The Surface L4 allows you to unlock your device with a face ID, so no more fingerprint is needed. It has been very responsive on unlocking with very few hiccups, for reference I do use glasses.The webcam itself is fine, I guess. Though for Microsoft, you'd think they could've borrowed a camera from their Surface lineup as the webcam is 720p. It will get you through video calls without a doubt, but any reasonable USB webcam will beat it hands down.Microphone quality is very good and would rival most of my coworker's audio setups - doing simple voice-over work shouldn't be an issue as long as you aren't typing or using the trackpad as the microphone does pick those up easily.Screen:The 13.5 Pixelsense 3:2 display is a marvel. There are only a handful of square laptops back on the market and it is a shame they aren't around more. I think much of the appeal of the Surface lineup comes from their unique displays. My particular display doesn't have any noticeable light bleeding against a dark background and has exceptional brightness, but no HDR.The screen is marvellous and while 16:9 video won't be able to fullscreen anymore, reading text on articles or code is far more enjoyable.This is a self note about the SL4: Why does this laptop have a touchscreen with stylus enabled when you can't rotate it past the ~120-degree mark? You can use it with the Microsoft Stylus and draw on it, but without the ability to flatten the screen it makes no sense. It's probably integrated into the display but I don't understand why it's a selling feature.Overall:If you need the best traditional laptop money can buy, the Surface can be on your list. I have more powerful laptops than the Surface, but generally, choose this device as it is just nicer to use on a day to day basis as a laptop. However, there is no denying that the value aspect is lost here compared to others on the market with 360 hinges and more upgradable components - the tradeoff is the unique screen, build quality, and support from the company that makes Windows. I can easily recommend the Surface for a large group of buyers but may recommend others to look at what they need a laptop for and adjust which version of the SL4 to purchase.",4
1088,Microsoft,Great laptop for School I absolutely love this laptop. It's great for grad school. So much storage and the touch screen capability helps me a lot. I would definitely recommend this if you looking for a versatile laptop for school.,5

1090,Microsoft,"Hurt my ears after a while I have to wear my head phones for a long period of time, as much as 5-6 hours at a time.After about 2 hours, these are really hurting my ears.There is not enough padding on them so you can feel the hard surface under what little padding is there.",3
1091,Microsoft,"Right off the bat, not worth the money. After reading reviews about this product and having experience it myself, I'm better off with using the general earbud headsets that came with my Samsung Galaxy and Apple iPhone.The story goes, I wanted a high-end headset, but it had to come with a 3.5mm plug so I can insert it into my laptop's headphone/mic combo jack or my phones. I looked up recommendations for ""top headsets"" but they often came with USB plugs. However, I noticed that the Jabra Evolve 40 can unplug from the USB adapter so I was interested. Found a used one on Amazon ($40) that ONLY came with the headset and not the USB adapter. I thought ""perfect"". Turns out, the USB adapter probably has a built-in preamp, so without it, the volume on the mic was VERY QUIET even on max volume and max mic boost settings. Everyone on the other side of my conference calls could barely hear me. I only made it ""sort of"" work by force bending the mic arm right to my mouth (almost eating it), which is another flaw of the headset because the microphone arm is not bendable at all. It just swivels up and down. I didn't want to break the arm so I had to track down a USB adapter on eBay ($25) and waited for that to come in. Now I'm stuck with the very thing I wanted to avoid using. A USB headset.I'm dreading the day the USB adapter fails because that's probably why the vendor that sold me the headset in the first place didn't have it. Not to mention various reviews on Amazon had users mentioning that this is the first piece to go. Also, the cable quality at the neck of the plugs could use a revamp because it looks like mine is beginning to break. QA could definitely use some work.Pros:- better than my laptop mic in terms of noise isolation. For those who know about microphone terminology, it acts as a ""dynamic mic"" instead of the laptop's ""condenser"" mic.-headphone cushions are soft and squishy-the headphone portion sounds great for voice. Takes out the muffle so I can clearly hear someoneCons:-inflexible mic arm (if you move it in front of your mouth, you can hear breathing. If you move it below, you risk the arm scraping against your chin and they will hear your jaw brushing against the mic arm) they should have included a foam tip-if you use the 3.5mm plug by itself, it's near silent. Pretty impossible to use the headset without the USB adapter.-no bass. If you're expecting some ""bring down the house"" bass with these headphones then you can forget about it. I think these were designed only for conferencing",3
1092,Microsoft,Excellent headset! The sound quality using this headset is way better than the Bluetooth speaker device that I was using and lower in cost to.,5
1093,Microsoft,"Seems inferior Something from the get go didn’t seem right. Product in a zip lock bag, no box, no instructions and appeared used. Product either a return, open box special or generic. Should have shopped around, paid premium. Very disappointed.",3

1095,Microsoft,"Seriously broken exactly a year after purchase I purchased these exactly a year ago today. I purchased these because my company provided me with a pair and the headphone fell off...I figured it was because maybe they sent a ""cheaper"" version...so I splurged. Well don't you know....after exactly ONE YEAR my headphone fell off...like clockwork!I expected more out of these. I do love them, they are great for noise cancelling. I don't need to yell into the mic to be heard and provide me enough volume without bursting my eardrums...but I can't see spending this much money every year.",2
1096,Microsoft,Nice headphones Overall a nice set of headphones. Don’t really get a big noise canceling reduction with them on. What I like least about these headphones is the hard plastic for the microphone. I wish it was able to bend and be manipulated to where you want your microphone to sit.,4

1099,Microsoft,Great for working from home I have worked from home for the past 7 years and find Jabra to be the best noise cancellation headphones.The sound quality is perfect and the volume controls is comfortable to useThey are very comfortable to wear and don't cause pressure on my ears.

It’s features include everything I loved about my Mac, but integrates easily with Microsoft. Everything from the look and feel to set up has been easy and user-friendly.",5
1112,Microsoft,"A great purchase and wonderful quality. Let me start out by saying I am in no way a qualified tech critic, this is just my opinion of the laptop as an average consumer.So a little bit of backstory- I haven’t really had great access to technology throughout my life. The devices I have used have been low in quality and were simply devices I could use to get by. I am, however, a junior in highschool and I’ve recently started taking some extra college classes, so I needed something that was going to last and be efficient to use on a daily basis for classes, communication, games, etc… And this laptop was just that!.The laptop boots up within seconds, even upon opening it for the first time. It was very user friendly and the virtual assistant, Cortana, walked me through the set-up process. Like I said, I’m not very tech-savvy and it was very easy for me to get logged in.In reviews online many people have said the keyboard was amazing and cutting edge. Upon arrival, this laptop’s keyboard is seriously so great. I wish I could describe it, but it is really a wonderful typing experience. There is also a fabric-like material that covers the keyboard surface that is nice and soft on the hands. Even after extended periods of typing, my hands don’t get very fatigued.I didn’t think I would use the touch screen very much, but the feature is nice and easy to use. I have found myself using it more often than I thought!The mousepad is nice and big- I personally prefer using a regular mouse but I still like the mousepad regardless.It is VERY fast in loading and downloading things. In my experience, I don’t think I’ve ever had a laptop that loads as quickly as this one. It has only crashed once and that was when I was trying to play a video game and do other things like downloading software and opening browsers at the same time, so I don’t blame it for being a little bit overwhelmed. After I had turned it off and back on it worked fine so there is no need to let the crash bother me. In the future I will separate those tasks so it doesn’t happen again.It runs video games very nicely; I have used it with the Sims 4 and I was impressed at how well it ran whilst not being a gaming laptop. However, this laptop is not built for gaming so if you plan to play many triple A games I don’t think this laptop is for you. It is reliable for casual games though!The battery life is nice, it isn’t horrible or amazing, it is just pretty good. The charger is medium length and it fits in and goes out nicely so it’s not a problem to just plug the computer in while using it.I think that’s about everything; I have tried to include a lot about the product as I know when shopping for laptops I wanted to know almost everything about it. In conclusion this laptop will be a major help to me as I go through college and it is really nice to have something that is reliable, fast, easy to use, and will do the tasks I need it for. :)(Sidenote: It actually shipped here a day earlier than the estimated shipping time! It was well packaged and very secure so I am also very delighted with the nature that it was shipped to me in :D)",5
1113,Microsoft,"Perfect for School/College Work Refurbished laptop computer came without the original box and does not have any instructions or manuals with it. The power cord came wrapped up being held with packing tape. Not the best packing job but my purchase came in perfect/nearly perfect condition. It was in a sealed USPS bubble envelope, with around 3-4 wraps of bubble wrap. The box was filled with packing peanuts on top as well as on the bottom of the computer. I knew I was getting a refurbished computer and kind-of knew what to expect. Just wish it would have come a little bit more original as the factory would have boxed it. At least the manual would be great. Also, it does come with the manufactirers warranty. Other than that, I am pleased with it overall.With the performance or what the laptop is best for......School/College Work mainly.

1122,Microsoft,Ordered twice and broken each time 2nd one broken when it arrived,1
1123,Microsoft,Love the product The computer is not touchscreen.You might need to mention to who ever pulls the product to be little easier,5
1124,Microsoft,Awesome Great computer! Using it for school and also for travel for my business.,5
1125,Microsoft,I don’t recommend this seller I bought a computer 3 months ago. After a month I updated it and the computer died. I contacted customer service because was under warranty. The female who emailed me was so rude. I lost my money!!! I wish I find the email so I can posted it.,1
1126,Microsoft,"DO NOT BUY Do not buy! This computer has no functionality. All I do is write papers and research the web nothing crazy virus stuff.. and this computer can not handle it. It is always freezing and blacking out. On top of that the if you come from an Apple computer definitely do not do it. Also the keyboard has too many functions that click while your typing, random stuff will be happening then you look up and you third paragraph is missing. 🙄 I just want to type- I don’t need a bunch of gadgets on the keyboard. I can see why they thought it was cool to add on -but it is not.This computer is literally for a child one only needs one window open. I purchased this as a quick buy as my apple is getting old And slows down and amazon prime priced this at $380 and yup you get exactly what you pay for. My 2013 apple works better And faster than this. Save all your documents continually because this computer will freeze for 20-30min and do not take a test or anything timed or you will be sorry. Definitely Would not suggest! Just spend the money for an adequate computer that matches your speed and needs. Lastly, it feels super plastic, which wouldn’t be a bad thing if it actually worked.",2
1127,Microsoft,"Perfect I really love this laptop. It's lightweight, easy to use, and the laptop bag that came with it is great.",5
1128,Microsoft,Great Touch screen,5
1129,Microsoft,Gone bad Memory is too small，,1
1130,Microsoft,Meets My Needs It is great to get a small unit that runs windows,5
1131,Microsoft,"Microsoft go I love the fact that it is a touch screen, small enough to look like you are carrying a book or notebook. Don't have windows, excel or power point.It gets hot quick and the battery does not last long. Otherwise it is a great computer to have, love it",5
1132,Microsoft,I like this tablet/computer! I really like this little computer/tablet. It handles what I throw at it very well. It’s not a powerhouse but I wanted convenient portability more than anything.,4
1133,Microsoft,I like it It came with Windows 10 Pro.,5
1134,Microsoft,"Horrible blue screen that whatever you try....WILL NOT STOP This one of the worst tablets that i have came across especially for the expensive price but thought it would be worth it. So badly mistaken, which is an understatement to say that i only feel regret among othe negative feelings. Literally the first 48hrs started showing the awful blue screen which little did i know would be what would haunt me and give many hours of headache result of the blue screen that ruins EVERYTHING.I thought i would be able to fix the blue screen with your simple antivirus programs or cleaning the computer for bugs anything sprt of thing. Resetting many times.",1
1135,Microsoft,package received package received,5
1136,Microsoft,I don't suggest The battery was great at the beginning and now it dies in 2 hours from a full charge. I haven't even had it for a year.,4
1137,Microsoft,"MUISLEADING PHOTO THE WHOLE STORY IS THE VENDOR HAS A PICTURE OF A TABLET AND KEYOARD ""PACKAGE . IWAS SENT A TABLET ONLY- MY SON OPENED I WHEN I WAS NOT A T HOME STARTED TO SETUP 4 ME NOW I NEED TO SPEND HOURS TRYING TO DELETE INFO HE INPUT! I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PICTURE WAS MENT TO DECIEVEAT ALL REVISITING THE SITE I NOTED THEY ALSO STATED - I THINK--""TABLET ONLY"" WANT TO RETURN",1
1138,Microsoft,"Waste of $500 Touchscreen won't calibrate, all Microsoft systems say there is a touchscreen hardware failureBattery life is very short.Maybe that's why there was a ""deal"" on this model.I purchased almost a year ago, and never bothered to check the tablet mode ( I have another tablet) until it was too late to return.",2
1139,Microsoft,"Missing items from order I disn;t realize until just the other day when I tried to use earbuds that they were supposed to be included with surface go along with adapter but were not........please send earbuds and adapter to me, thank you.",1
1140,Microsoft,Issues with charging Computer will not charge. Either has an issue with the charging port or the cord that was sent with it has an issue.,3
1141,Microsoft,Great Laptop but fan Easy to setup and use however fan at times runs way too loud. Wasn't sure it was a problem or just the way it works.,4
1142,Microsoft,"pink HP I can't tell from the picture, but if this is the new pink HP I LOVE IT!!!!!!",5
1143,Microsoft,"Amazing for an ""on the move student"" I have used this laptop for the past 2 years without any issues. I currently have a set up with 2 external monitors and it supports it through the single C-port that it has, but the only thing that I wish it had was an additional C-port and HDMI access. But this laptop is amazing at $1,700.",5
1144,Microsoft,"Microsoft rules! Amazing cumputer, really good, my work flows really better with this tool.",5
1145,Microsoft,"Perfect for me. I love the surface line up, was forced to get another computer since had to take online courses and I have no issues. This thing does everything I need it to do,the screen is beautiful and it gets me through the day.",5
1146,Microsoft,"Don't buy Amazon renewed, last less than a year I give this a one star because the product lasted less than a year. I shut it down one night and not it doesn't start.",1
1147,Microsoft,"I love my surface book. Update 5/5/2020: After about 20 days the Suface Book would shut down and refuse to power up. The seller promptly approved the return and provided a shipping label.I do not want to believe the Surface Book in any way. It is a great device. However, I am now even more reticent to purchase refurbished electronics.I ordered a new Surface Book 2 from another seller and it arrived today. I still love it. I'm not going to take off any stars just because I received a defective refurbished unit. S*** happens.😁I had both a Surface Tablet and a Surface Book where I used to work. Unfortunately, they wanted those back when they canned me. Farging Bastiges!I hit a little extra on a scratch off a few months ago so I splurged and bought my own Surface Tablet but still wanted I Surface Book.About a month ago I decided to take the plunge.Now, I am not a fan of refurbished anything. Heck, I don't even like leftovers! But, the price for this Surface with the I7 was cheaper than the new I5 so I decided to take a chance. No regrets.All the accessories and manuals were included; there are absolutely no physical marks to indicate it was refurbished and it works perfectly.Thanks Amazon for a great deal and Microsoft for a great computer!",5
1148,Microsoft,Unstable. I had USB-C to HDMI problem with this device. It disconnects every minute. Display port was better than worthless USB-C which is not thunderbolt. My Surface Book 1 with Display Port works perfectly. I do not recommend this device for serious work. It is more akin to iPad which is a toy. Thanks.,2
1149,Microsoft,"Fantastic refit Love it, great multifunction device",5
1150,Microsoft,Like new I got this product renewed and saved a TON!!! Looks brand new and works great,5
1151,Microsoft,"Phenomenal system, excellent operation! Battery only downside. This computer is a DREAM for digital creative applications, as long as you have an outlet available. Battery life is substantially lower than Microsoft advertises for this system, but that is true even for non-refurbished models. To the best of my knowledge, I don't think there's a better 2-in-1 - or hell, even straight laptop - for digital illustration / film editing / modeling / etc. Well worth the investment if you can spare it!",5
1152,Microsoft,Great laptop Looks and acts brand new just battery life dies faster,4
1153,Microsoft,Fulfills all needs Working great right out of the box. Love the touch screen functionality and the soft aware that walks a person through the set up.,5
1154,Microsoft,"Super thin I love how this it is and love the touch screen also, great quality and the external drive I got for it lets me download DVD's and software.",5
1155,Microsoft,"Better Than My Mac Honestly After I started using my surface laptop I felt like I had been missing out on so much. It’s faster, lighter, and more efficient than my other laptop. I Am in Medical school and the surfacejust makes everything more convenient.",5
1156,Microsoft,Surface to Surface The best laptop you can buy.,5

1162,Microsoft,Excellent option The computer deliver before I specter. At this moment work properly and I'm very happy.,4
1163,Microsoft,Good laptop for music production!!! This laptop has def surpassed my expectations. I use it for music production and it is a beast when it comes to processing and memory. Hell even the hard drive is great with a TB of hard drive you can’t go wrong with the price.,5
1164,Microsoft,Great computer Great computer,5
1165,Microsoft,Amazing Love it !!!,5
1166,Microsoft,Did not receive Stylus Great laptop. Took two stars off because I did not receive the stylus as it was advertised!!! False advertising!!!,3
1167,Microsoft,La recomiendo Muy buena,5
1168,Microsoft,Good replacement for price Bought as a replacement in o the original cord as the attachment into the tablet for charging is not built sturdy.Very important when utilizing for virtual school.,5
1169,Microsoft,Not quite right Good cord and shipped fast but makes my computer be “jumpy”,4

1174,Microsoft,Good for Price definitely charges well and had good cord length. almost identical to original,5
1175,Microsoft,Great if you travel or lost your original charging cord Works perfectly with a Microsoft surface laptop!,5
1176,Microsoft,Don't Waste Your Money This charger wigged out after only 2 weeks. Keep browsing.,1
1177,Toshiba,Rip off do not purchase I sent this to my sister because her was broken.She found that it was not compatible with her stuff. Returned it and out of 605.$ they returned 129.$ because of re-stock charges! Amazon returned an additional 250. But that is nothing but theft.,1
1178,Toshiba,"Pretty much what I needed in a laptop My fault, I didn’t notice that this model didn’t come with a dvd/cd drive. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.",4
1179,Toshiba,Do Not Buy I should have returned this when I first found problem. I waited too long thinking it was my wi-fi. Kept shutting down during my Virtual Calls when I was the Host of business meetings. I had to buy another computer and another brand.Not this One. It sits on my shelf. I wish I could get a refund.,1
1180,Toshiba,Too expensive for the lack of memory This product is old and has no memory.I had to get back up memory in a few days.,2
1181,Toshiba,New computer Just setting it up now. Everything looks great,5
1182,Toshiba,"3rd Tosiba we bought This replaced our relativly new HP laptop,THis is the 3rd Tosiba we have bought over the years,excellent product,We were so disappointed with our very expensive( and not working) HP, we will never ever buy an HP laptop again.Not sure what lured us away from Toshiba,",5
1183,Toshiba,"Not What I Expected... So I ordered this laptop with the thought that I'd be able to use it for a project and sadly that wasn't the case. The CD disk drive doesn't have a button to let it open and at this point I can't return it. I think I made a mistake and unfortunately am stuck. Hopefully I can find something else in the meantime. I found the actual website to register it for a warranty and not only does it not work but the 'Contact' form isn't functional as well. All I want is an exchange for the laptop I ordered. This makes me think it's a scam but I'm trying to be positive. As for the specs, its actually pretty good. Not to heavy, or bulky. Decent size screen, and the clarity is on point. If you're looking for a laptop to get you through, this isn't a bad choice. Depending on exactly what you need, I'd read again before buying. Ultimately I'm disappointed because the reason I bought it, it isn't functional for.",2
1184,Toshiba,"Great Laptop, I liked it a lot Got this beautiful laptop as a birthday gift from my hubby and truly loved it. It quite light and has many new functions to it which are very useful and beneficial. Highly recommended and a five stars.",5
1185,Toshiba,Great laptop for value Computer arrived In perfect working order. The speed is great for the web searching and social media reviewing my mom does. She’s very happy with this laptop.,5
1186,Toshiba,Works well Good size and works well for my purposes.,5
1187,Toshiba,"Good laptop at a great price Aside from being harassed by microsoft several times a day, the only other problem is being signed up for Norton, which I did NOT do, I like the computer just fine.",4
1188,Toshiba,"Great value for an SSD For years I put off buying a laptop with a solid state drive, mainly because one, they were so expensive, and two, not enough storage.Finding a laptop with a 1TB SSD that was also reasonably priced allowed me to finally make the change/So far I am quite pleased.It is quick, well made, and I am very happy with my purchase.",5
1189,Toshiba,Not quite what I expected It’s light to carry around.Some of the features I thought was on this computer was notStill a good laptop.,4
1190,Toshiba,"Crashed I just received this and just as I finished loading a bunch of sensitive info including all my passwords onto it, it crashed and could not be accessed. I am returning it for a refund, but all of my passwords are still on it. I really hope when I return it, they delete everything that's on the computer.",1
1191,Toshiba,Great computer all around. I use this for games and it works perfectly.,5
1192,Toshiba,"I’m lovin’ it! I have always been a Toshiba fan.This DynaBook is living up to the Toshiba name.It was easy to hook up, fast moving and I am loving it!",5
1193,Toshiba,Great for students Works better than expected for the price. It works really well and I am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely recommend this laptop for any student out there.,5
1194,Toshiba,"This Dynabook is very user friendly. The more I use this computer, the better it gets as it easily lets me set it up the way I like things which means lots of privacy in the things I do.I haven't had it very long but so far the only slight issue that I've found is that sometimes when listening to various speakers the audio gets ""scratchy"" from time to time.Really looking forward to getting involved in all it's capabilities.",5
1195,Toshiba,I am very happy with my purchase. It is just what I need basic . Fast user friendly. Very user friendly nothing big. But speed is fast size and weight are at 100%.,5
1196,Toshiba,Spent alot of money.Disappointed. I had another Toshiba and it was great. Bought this during the christmas holidays. Nice pc but the sound in it is awful! It sounds hollow. You have to wear headphones to hear the sound. They definitely cheaped out on the sound. Also the camera is terrible. You look so grainey. I tried adjusting the setting but it didn't help. I had a zoom interview today and my side of the screen was terrible. Wouldn't recommend. If I could return it I would!,2
1197,Toshiba,"Fast, Reliable and well Built I last owned a Toshiba in the 1990s. I don't know why I stopped buying them. That one lasted for years. I passed it onto my daughter. This PC is excellent. It is fast, reliable and well built.My recent experience with Dells and HPs is that American laptops last about three years. They tend to be flimsy and start falling apart. I would highly recommend this PC.",5
1198,Toshiba,"Works great and fast shipping I am very pleased with this new laptop. I've been using it for over a month now and I appreciate the sharpness and vibrant color and it's ease of use. It can be a bit sensitive sometimes and I end up shutting it off when I slide my finger across the mouse. But I like that the mouse is solid so that no crumbs, hair or dust get underneath and all the clicking I do when I play my online games don't wear out any springs. Interesting that Dynabook is the new name for Toshiba, though. I replaced my 5 yr old Toshiba with this Dynabook laptop and it feels very much like my old Toshiba, which made it easy to use from the start with no learning curve. My old Toshiba's wiring got pinched from a dog running into the screen while I was on the bed, so the screen colors were swirly and green and I was unable to see images clearly. I could use it for a while like that if I only opened my screen a specific distance, but it got worse and worse over time. Hopefully this new Dynabook laptp won't have that same issue once day. The screen hinges do seem sturdy so far.",5

1201,Toshiba,"Excellent purchase!! Th is laptop was more than I expected for the price. It is everything as advertised, very high quality.",5

1205,Toshiba,"Toshiba's are outstanding computers This is the fourth Toshiba laptop we've had over a period of 15 years.A few years ago I broke from tradition and bought an HP.Huge mistake, what a piece of garbage.Won't make that mistake again.The only thing my wife doesn't like about this computer is the oversized mouse pad.Other than that, she loves it.",4
1206,Toshiba,Great machine Great machine,5
1207,Toshiba,"You Get What You Pay For This is the 4th Toshiba laptop that I have purchased in the past few years. I didn’t know what to expect, so I was pleasantly surprised at some of the features that I did get. Absolutely nothing beyond bare bones. Outside of the windows 10 OS you get a 30 day free trial to Windows 365 and 1T cloud storage.At first, this is not exactly what you want but I didn’t want to spend a lot so I got what I paid for not much.By taking advantage of the free trial offer on Windows 365 I got to use Word 365. It took me a little time to get used to its functions but once I got a grip on what to do, it turned out to be terrific. I have used Word from its earliest incarnations but this is the best of the best. I fell in love with what I initially thought would be so much so what. But it is what people like to say awesome.I did have to add some additional items to suit my tastes like an external optical drive, extended URL connections, additional hard drive storage, wireless mouse and fingerprint recognition. So for about an additional $200 I got the extras and the kind of laptop I need at this time.So far I’m happy with my purchase. Oh, yes, the Windows 365 costs $99 +tax for one year renewal at the same amount. Not too bad considering buying it independently, it would be double the cost. All in all a decent functional laptop at an affordable price point for what you want.",5

The system runs well so far, easily connects to either the local Wi-Fi or hardwired network and performs well.Windows 10 Pro is a little quirky, but after some adjustments it's working the way I want.I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so difficult to get Windows working the way I wanted.",4
1213,Toshiba,Always a Toshiba I use this computer for home. It's fast and easy to use. I had a Toshiba in the past and loved it then tried a Dell when it's had too many viruses to continue working. I gave my one-year-old del to my son because it has too many problems. I love my Toshiba,5
1214,Toshiba,Just don’t This is horrible so disappointed. I got for my husband for his birthday.He never gets himself anything new like never.So i got this laptop for himhe has a toshiba but i wanted him to hv an updated one.Well this one isnt updated like his other one at all and of course if u open it u cantreturn it.All i say is plz read all thing this laptop can do.

The start up was worrysomely long, the mouse pad is hard for me to use (will look for a sensitivity setting & my wireless mouse). Since this came to me thru an ""upgrade"" site (Computer Upgrade King) don't understand why it wasn't considerably more out of the box ready & burned in?

I was worried when I had read that Toshiba was not doing laptops any longer but when I discovered the DynaBook was actually the Toshiba,I was thrilled.",5

I know it's probably an easy fix so that is not the main reason this is not rated higher. If you need this for college I would probably just go with a Windows computer because there have been a couple times throughout school where I needed to download a program that is not supported by Chromebook so I had to check out a Windows computer from the school or use a computer at the library. Sort of annoying. But if you are just using it for everyday personal use I really love the Chromebook!",3

It was running when I got a blue screen of death on the first one, but it was not running on the second one when it died.",1
1249,Toshiba,Bad Computer I was happy until on the second day after the “return window closed this computer froze up locked up and will not reboot. I have contacted the seller I am very very unhappy and I require a refund,1
1250,Toshiba,"Just Like the Original Toshiba, just with a different name. Worth the investment. What I like about the product is the fact that the key board with the number pad to the right and numbers at the top, it is more user friendly than the just having the numbers at the top. Typing is smooth and it doesn't take much pressure. With the purchase I made, the Laptop has a CD R/W, HDMI port, multi-USB ports, Ethernet Port, Printer Port/Dual screen port, Card Reader and has enough speed and storage for gaming. Everything you need for whenever you need it.If you have ever had a Toshiba in the past, than all the key are set-up just like the earlier versions, so switching to the Dynabook is no difference. Same quality, not as heavy as the previous ones. The picture resolution is great, the storage is great, speed is great, memory is great. I have no complaints.Though Ithink I need to buy a back-up one, just in case they quit making them!!. I Just Love it.",5
1251,Toshiba,Not ready for prime time. Don’t buy this laptop. Buggy bios. After less than a month boot system corrupt. Time consuming Pita to repair,1
1252,Toshiba,"Not Great I have been using a Toshiba laptop for the past 5 years and needed a new one. I love Toshiba. What I do not love is the fact that while this is advertised as having all you need, you only have it in the cloud. I absolutely hate this. Everything you work on is automatically saved to the cloud. If you want to work on a document on the laptop offline only, it only opens in Word Pad (seriously?!). Absolutely awful. I am a science writer and an editor, this is not at all helpful to me, I am still trying to figure out a way to get what I need from this, instead of what Microsoft wants to force on me. There is nothing wrong with the laptop, it is the functionality of Office 365 that makes it a bust for me.",3
1253,Toshiba,"Perfect until not Arrived early, easy setup, spent some time getting it set up for use and the hard drive shorted out. Amazon was fantastic, as always, took it back w/no argument. Called DynaBook, spoke w/Jacob who was honest and told me they were having a minimal problem w/the hard drive upgrade. It’s too bad because it was screaming fast before it broke. I mean it was lighting fast and everything, keyboard, touchpad, display and software worked perfectly. Thanks to Amazon for stepping up and taking it back.",1

I wanted light and sleek.DOWNSIDES: no backlit keyboard. No Touch Point in the center of the keyboard. Display is Non-Touch. The speakers are fine for radio, lousy for music. Won't win any design awards. Boots surprising slowly for an i7 with SSD hard drive - maybe five seconds longer than my 2014 Toshiba Portege Z30.UPSIDES: a non-reflective display with rich colors. It's very easy on the eyes and good for movies. An excellent (excellent) touch-pad even though it looks bland. Battery lasts 5-6 hours watching movies. Comes with DVD drive. Power adapter is 2-prong plug and small for a large laptop (output 19V and 2.37A).OTHER: I haven't used the ample ports but I expect them to function per their specs.",4

I’ve had it for several months and run Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, and After Effects, plus live stream multiple cameras using USB inputs into OBS studio software.

Only negatives are it does not have a backlit keyboard, and the edge of the laptop where your hand rests while using the finger pad is very sharp and will scrape and even cut your hand after extended use. You’ll have to put tape or something over the edge. The sound quality from the built-in speakers isn’t very good either.",5

Round and round trying to contact Discount PC store, only getting a response when I pushed a ticket with Amazon customer service. They said too bad, too late, go to Toshiba for their warranty. Lots of money later in shipping Toshiba says that the problem is the 1T hard drive that Discount PC put in that is NOT COMPATIBLE with Toshiba products and not covered by their warranty.The ball is back in Discount PC's court.

1274,Huawei,"DOES NOT LAST!!! DO NOT BUY SINCE IT WILL BREAK IN 2 YEARS. This is my first bad Amazon review, and I feel like this laptop deserved it.TLDR: Laptop is great for a year, then starts having overheating problems and crashes. Repaired 3 times, to no avail. DO NOT BUY, just invest in a MacBook instead.I'm currently a college student, and bought this laptop 3 years ago for school. It was great at the time -- as a previous review said, 90% of a macbook for 70% of the price. The touchscreen was pretty fun to use sometimes, but not terribly useful. The touchpad was alright, the keyboard is fine. The display still works pretty good for me.HOWEVER, my laptop started breaking down after the first year. It would crash unexpectedly at times, and since I had a 2-year warranty, I sent in my laptop to get it fixed. Came back, and ran great for half a year, before the problem started recurring again. I use my laptop every day (since I'm a computer science student), and having this laptop break down on me at random times made it quite stressful. After a few months of coping with random crashes every other week or so, I decided to send my laptop in again. Came back, and still had problems. This was year 2. At this point, I had tried everything possible. I factory reset my laptop, changed settings, searched up the crash errors, submitted reports to people online, etc. When my 2-year warranty expired, I read some Reddit posts and took apart the laptop to try and fix the problem, which I ultimately believe to be overheating. After applying new thermal glue to my CPU and getting a good cooling fan, the crashes stopped happening for half a year. And now, THEY'RE BACK. Are you telling me I have to replace my laptop's thermal glue and check up on the cooling system every few months to half a year? Honestly, with the time and money I spent repairing this thing, I could've gone back in time to tell myself to get a Mac instead. Apple support is much better too.After inspecting the Huawei laptop architecture more, I realize that it is poorly designed. There's only one fan, and the heat sink is simply not enough. They should've at least added in another fan. This laptop is slim, but they very much underestimated how much it would overheat.That was my mini rant, thanks for reading!- broke college student",1
1275,Huawei,"Great Computer - when it works! After 3 months it started acting up frequently being interrupted by the infamous BSOD.At 6 months, had the HDD replaced. At 14 months had the processor changed. Problems with drivers was ongoing. At 18 months, the MB. All along experienced BSOD. Only the frequency ever varied. In the fall of 2020, went into perpetual BSOD. I have been trapped in CN since 12/20/19 due to CoVid. Huawei in China won't even look at it as I purchased it in US. Huawei in US virtually non-existent - and even less helpful.Huawei CA was helpful over the phone and offered to look at it, but Canada customs won't let me ship it from China. So just minutes ago, I decided to cut my losses with this computer and trash it. Will never again buy anything with the Huawei name on it. Thought since I was (well was and someday will be again) making a smart move should i need service on two continents. Wrong. Spent $1515 to purchase and another $1050 on replacement parts and local geek service. Incredible.",1

1278,Huawei,"Broke after 2.5 years It was actually a pretty decent laptop for the price tag... but that doesn't really matter if the whole thing breaks after only 2.5 years.It's a common problem for the motherboards to give out after a couple years (after warranty expires), which prevents charging and even just powering on. While it was working it also had major issues with overheating, even just while idling. It also had issues with the fingerprint scanner.",1
1279,Huawei,Very bad experience The screen suddenly shuttered for no reason so I coudnt use the touch mode anymore. After three months the motherboard stopped working. Not repairable :(,2
1280,Huawei,"Don't buy this I bought the I7 one, the battery, the screen and everything outside is nice. But the cooling is pasive in a plate that a fan tries to pass air into so cooling is no great and fans will work a lot and the nvme will get hot and perform a lot worse. Why don't buy this? One day after 1 and half years of use, finished using it closed the lid and the next day it didn't turn on, the cause told by my technician was that the NVidia graphics card died and because of it the rest of the system won't turn on, the joke is that i almost never used the dedicated graphic instead I used the integrated graphics from the Intel processor.",1

The keyboard is pretty good too by the way not the best key travel but it's what I've come to expect with laptops of this profile. One day however it just wouldn't boot at all.

They never offered to repair or replace the unit, and I would not trust them to do so.

1323,Huawei,"If you had a Windows OS or Apple OS 2in1 touch laptop previously, expect a downgrade So I have a love/hate relationship with this laptop. There's a bunch of pros and cons. Let's get to the pros first. Pros : Fires up instantly as soon as turned on and easy setup as soon you first get it. Takes less than 5 minuets to setup. Easy to navigate and download apps. If you already have google chrome setup on another device everything comes back just the way you had it. Really simplistic in design and is light weight and durable (it probably can handle a modest accident without breaking or the screen shattering). The screen does not wobble like some other 2in1's. Apps and other programs do not lag and fire up quickly. Now here is the dreaded cons. Cons: If you are not used to a Chromebook it is a super awkward OS! Nothing made complete sense to me about the OS from the start. I got used to it but it still is weird to me. The sound quality is subpar, it does not get loud enough for my taste either. The screen resolution is about as good as the original Kindle fire HD resolution circa 2012 - pretty much years behind to the current technology resolution. 64 gigs storage is simply not enough space to store music, pictures and movies, if you have google cloud that's your best bet to go about storage. This is not a gaming device, if you are into gaming the hardware can not support an intricate modern video game. The battery life is definetly not 9 hours! Maybe if you just left it on and did absolutely nothing with it, it can stay alive for that duration of time (on the flip side it does charge up fairly fast, about 1hr 30 mins). Lastly, it just does not have the feel of a laptop compared to Windows OS or Apple OS. I find myself getting frustrated with the way everything is setup on a Chrome OS.Overall not horrible, but not great. The reason I purchased this Lenovo was the price and wanted a touch screen computer to hold me over because my old HP touch 2in1 is all cracked and busted up. So I will use this one just for browsing the internet and other simplistic functions. Great for a kid to use and keep them occupied but as an adult it lacks functions that a real deal OS can provide. Expect a major downgrade if you go from Windows to this OS and just in general just a major downgrade. This would be state of the art if this was released in the early 10's(?). Hope this was insightful. 4/10 is my grade on this efficient yet awkward device.",3

1349,Huawei,Laptops great but it's missing the promised ssd Great product for the price but I wouldn't write this review if it weren't for the missing sad that big metal piece next to the fan is where the ssd is supposed to be there's no 32gigs of external memory and no ssd.TIPS1. You may have heard that it's only in windows a however this is fixable just ask google how to get rid of windows s windows s is the limited version of windows it doesn't allow online downloads. It only allows downloads from the Microsoft storen2. Laptop is very upgradable the ram cap is 20 gigs I suggest get a kit of 2 8 gig sticks for optimal performance. Pretty much it's mostly open for upgrades even the wifi receiver is upgradable.,3

Not wanting to spend a lot of money on a new MacBook because I wasn’t sure if I would like it, I saw this one.It’s not a current edition but I figured it was new enough for me to give it a try. It is so light compared to my HP laptop and has much better battery life; I am still trying to figure it out.Delivery via FedEx was quick.",5
1355,Huawei,Great buy I was unsure if I was doing the right thing but I am very happy with this computer. It’s used so minor scuffing nothing major. The battery was shot but for under $40 I bought a new battery and YouTube helped me install it in less then 20 min . No complaints here . Well worth the money.,5
1356,Huawei,"Got mine from Platinum Deals Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The MacBook was in almost perfect condition, it has two scratches on the bottom. Really don’t care about that.

1358,Huawei,Not Worth The Money I thought getting a refurbished computer was the way to go as I have not had issue with other refurbished electronics that I have purchased. This is the most disappointed I have been in a refurbished item. This item came with scratches all over it and a chip out of the top corner of the screen.,1
1359,Huawei,"No manual I’m not tech savvy.Buying a refurbished laptop with no manual and no ideal how it functions, is very frustrating and disappointing.I honestly feel like canceling my internet service because of the lack of providing instructions how to operate this laptop.I’m beside myself with anger and don’t understand how you can refurbish a laptop and not provide any information about it.The worst purchase I’ve made from Amazon and I’m torn about whether I should return it or keep it and hope to figure it out.If you could send me a instructions manual about this laptop, I’ll be willing to provide another review.I don’t have any idea about the battery life, what the function keys provides and basic familiarity or capabilities about this laptop.Huge, huge disappointment!!!",1

1366,Huawei,Don't waste your money! Buy something else I got this computer for my son for his birthday and it is a terrible computer. Every time he goes to play a game or do anything on this computer he will all of a sudden get a face with x's for eyes and frowning and when that happens he has to restart his computer because it won't allow him to do anything else. This is just a piece of junk and I can't get anyone to help me with this they don't answer any of my emails. Trust me don't buy this computer.,1
1367,Huawei,"Annoying Operating System It works okay, not Chromebooks require downloading an app for everything, even things that are browser extensions such as a password keeper.It's annoying to get everything setup.

1368,Huawei,"Screen went dead won't honor warranty When the laptop was functioning it worked great for my daughter. Then the screen went black. I had to call many times to get someone who could help me @Lenovo. Then they said it was out of warranty, I had to show proof that it was in warranty once I did that they did not respond. I went though the same process again and still have not got any resolution. DO NOT BUY.",1

1371,Huawei,"Incredible graphics People use their laptops for different purposes, so I'll state mine right away. I write novels, I watch movies, and I edit film montages. I do not play games, nor do I use multiple programs at a time for work.So, for my purposes, this Dell XPS laptop is fantastic. You'll have to see it to believe how tiny and thin it is, which could be a pro or con depending on your point of view. Pro is it's easily transported, either around the house or traveling. Con is if you are watching a movie, it's a small screen. The keyboard is easy to use, and the touchpad is large. I'm still getting used to the touch screen, as it's very foreign to me. But then again, I'm also still getting used to the automatically installed Alexa and fingerprint scanning on/off button. Times are changing.As two of my three primary uses involves graphics, I'm extremely pleased. When I'm editing, I can really see the detail and there are no 'freeze ups' as my older computer would have. Movies seem like they're in high definition. The contrast in colors, (or if you pop in an old black-and-white noir) is really intense.As always, know what you're looking for in a laptop. If you're primary motivation is RAM, speed, graphics, size, etc, then look up what will be best for you. I'm a huge fan of Dell computers, and I expect this one to last as long as my last one (five years, and it didn't really die, I was just ready for an upgrade). The battery life is great, and even though the cords look a little weird in the box, you'll figure it out. My biggest con is the lack of ports, namely USB and HDMI, but you can't have everything. This is perfect for the traveler. Charge it up, watch a great movie on the airplane, and it won't weigh down or take up much room in your carry-on bag.",5
1372,Huawei,"Overrated Ended up sending it back. Runs super hot, good luck if you try to use it on your belly while laying in bed like me!Not as fast as expected even with the Intel 11th gen and 16GB of Ram, especially when you factor in the price...",3
1373,Huawei,"Beast of a travel laptop! At this screen size, which is just a bit larger than the premium tablets from Apple and Samsung, this is a laptop designed for travel.Because of the metal body it is not as light as some other laptops of similar size, but the build quality feels so much better.I absolutely love that they didn't scrimp on the hard drive and gave you a decent size.With an i7 processor and 16GB of RAM this laptop can handle audio and video processing while doing standard business and casual work at the same time.This is a premium laptop (at a premium price) designed to do serious heavy lifting, but I do wonder that all this power is in a laptop that is this size and obviously geared toward business travelers -- unless it's just for executives that want to have the latest and greatest for their PowerPoint presentations.Still, attached to a docking station with a large monitor, this will power through work and play.I've had no issues with the WiFi at all and this is only connected via WiFi in my setup.Dell is often thought of as the ""worker bee"" laptop company, but this laptop is more for queen bees.Very, very impressed.",5
1374,Huawei,"makes terrible noise sound like a tractor! makes terrible noise sound like a tractor, won't allow return 2 days after the very short return window",1
1375,Huawei,"Lightweight & great sound & color make this a nice computer... This teeny, tiny computer is so thin & lightweight, it practically fits in a manila envelope. I was able to get it set up fairly easily. I’m switching from a laptop that uses a touchpad or mouse & this has a touch screen. I’m going back & forth between computers to get everything set up & I prefer a mouse over a touchpad. Such a simple thing but it sure wastes time when you forget which device uses which.But on to this really nice Dell laptop. First, this thing is so lightweight. I always travel with my laptop & flying with this one that’s easy to slip into a slightly oversized purse & is extremely lightweight has improved traveling for me.The speakers have a nice clear sound so it was a winner in my book. I can’t always hear things very well & actually have a new flatscreen I’m ready to pitch out the door because it sounds like mush. No one else has that problem with it so I think it’s me but that doesn’t make me able to hear it any better. I hear everything just fine with this computer. I really enjoy that.I like the back lighting that makes it easy to use in a dark room. I don’t have a glare with this computer.Probably the best part for me is the OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diodes) that emit their own light when an electric current is passed through rather than having an external light source for brightness. The resulting colors are vibrant & crisp; good for watching things like YouTube & Netflix or Skyping & photoshopping. I can be doing what I want, watching what I want & I’m not disturbing anyone else in the room. I’m enjoying darker darks, lighter lights, brighter colors & have an excellent viewing experience. I didn’t realize what I was missing until I started watching it on this computer.It’s expensive to have that technology but this computer will last for years. It has a crazy long lifespan, the battery lasts around 6 hours before needing charged. I’m not a technology genius; all I can say is what I like & I like this computer. It’s tempting to get new games to see how much the graphics improve but I don’t need to do that. My husband, though, is very excited to use this computer for flight programs. I told him I’d think about it.",4

I tried every possible fix on forums to no avail. I even reached out to Intel technical support who manufacturer the ""Killer Wi-Fi"" cards for Dell. He said the name is befitting because ever since buying the Killer network company it's been nothing but nonstop issues and there is no fix.Don't believe me?

1380,Huawei,"everything good but beware OLED display Yes, this is a wonderful laptop and the display is stunning. But what Dell and OLED TV sellers won't tell you about is the unspoken pitfalls of OLED technology. Yes, they do provide the clearest, most stunning display of any screen technology. What they don't warn you about is after approximately 10k hours of use the OLED technology will result in irreversible burn-in, especially if any image, particularly red or green, is left static on the screen repeatedly. Since most laptop users keep their laptops on, or default to their desktops for extended periods, or are working spreadsheets for hours on end, or are using them for extended periods of time with the same parts of the screen remaining static for extended periods of time, a burn it will invariably result. It won't MIGHT happen...it WILL happen. This burn in is not correctable...the entire display needs to be replaced. For instance, if you use Facebook a lot and there are red dots on any of the icons on top of the page, and you don't click on them, it will result in a burn-in after an extended exposure. I have dealt with this twice on my LG 55"" OLED 4k SMART television. I enjoyed the best looking TV screen for approximately 10k hours of use and then POW...overnight I started seeing burn in from the ""Breaking News"" banners from CNN and from other programs which I watched all the time that had static images, such as their station logo in one of the corners; or if I had one of the TV's HDMI inputs set to my computer and I left the desktop on all the time with no screen saver activated. Luckily for me, my 5-year warranty protected me, but the same thing happened all over again. Since I also used my LG OLED 4k Smart TV as my computer monitor, I installed a screen saver on my computer that activates after 30 seconds so there is never the possibility of a burn in in case I accidently leave an image on the TV when it is displaying anything static from my computer. Any time I pause a TV program I am watching, I immediately switch the HDMI input to my computer and the screen saver kicks on in under 30 seconds as long as I don't move the mouse....hence no static image, which means no burn in. This is why OLED screens are not recommended for computer use, but are terrific for TV use PROVIDED YOU HAVE A COMPUTER WITH AN ACTIVATED 30-SECOND SCREEN SAVER ATTACHED THROUGH ONE OF THE TV'S HDMI INPUTS. My computer is still attached to my OLED TV. but when I use it now, I never go to a website that keeps a static image; I always have my 30-second screen saver activated; and I never leave the desktop static on my computer. Until the manufacturers solve the burn-in issues of OLED technology, it is safer to use QLED technology when it becomes available for laptops and computer monitors. OLED...great for TV's....not safe for computers yet.",3

Was all running fine own and then I woke up one morning to find it had reset itself to previous settings and basically uninstalled everything.

1403,Huawei,"Laptop is dysfunctional, customer support is incompetent I wish I had read all the one-star reviews for Asus on the Better Business Bureau site before I bought this laptop.I got this recently after reading some good reviews on Amazon (again, I wish I'd paid attention to all the negative ones). The internal speakers randomly stopped working after only 6 weeks. Long story short: no amount of troubleshooting fixed it, I mailed my new Asus laptop to the repair center over three weeks ago, and there appears to be no end in sight to the repair. At this point, the only phone number available to call gives either an error message or a busy signal, so there is literally no way to talk to anyone. The Asus repair center has had my laptop since July. I rely on my laptop to work, and I currently cannot work because I have no laptop.Again, this was a BRAND NEW laptop that malfunctioned for no reason. Asus sold me a dysfunctional machine, the repair process is obviously not working, and customer service support is now nonexistent. I want Asus to either send me a new computer, or I want my money back. This is my first experience as an Asus customer, and I am never, ever supporting this company again. Because my computer is being held hostage at the repair center and I NEED something to work on so that I can pay my bills, at this point it feels like Asus is forcing me to plunk down hundreds more dollars on a different company to buy a new computer. I have no trust whatsoever that this situation is going to be resolved. Do not waste your money on this lousy machine.",1

There were some scratches mentioned on the listing, but the computer I got is completely brand new with no damage!It boots up quickly, is VERY quiet, and is even thinner then I expected. (Despite being listed as an ultra-thin laptop, I was not expecting it to be this small) It weighs next to nothing and is actually a little bit smaller then I was expecting. It is smaller then my Macbook, which at the time was the smallest compute (size wise) that I owned. Though, they have the same screen size no matter the actually measured size difference.I plan to use it for business only, since I am a contract freelancer and needed a windows computer for some of my applications that aren't Mac friendly.

If you look at the bottom, there is only one place for ventillation, and that is small too. I had to buy cooling pads.If you look at second picture, that is the only place to cool it.

The screen is nice so far as I loaded in a bunch of photos and they look good.Keyboard is so-so, backlighting of it is, well, pretty light. But I have a separate gamers keyboard that I love so I'll be using that.What I don't like...THE TOUCH SCREEN IS STICKY. Seriously. sticky, like maybe you just ate something sugary and didn't wipe your hands properly. I hated the ASUS but damn it had a good touch screen. it could be because it feels more like glass. This feels like plastic and your finger sticks to it. It is also not that responsive. Maybe it will get better. I don't know.Also, I'm a fast typist and if I hit the keys at my top speed... I look like I don't know how to spell.right now I'm not impressed enough to give it a better rating.Backlighting is really weak and it goes off when you're not on it for a few second.",3
1418,Huawei,This computer is full of issues The computer has many issues,1
1419,Huawei,"great value Did a ton of research before buying this. Amazing combination of light weight, 15"" size and screen quality at less than 800 bucks.In addition to lightweight, screen quality was the other big factor.Great IPS panel. I couldn't find any laptop close to this price that had as good a screen. Great for photos when away from desktop monitors. Processor is a generation or two older, but still powerful and not a bottleneck for anything I'll use the laptop for.",5
1420,Huawei,"Lightweight and functional It is lightweight, the best in its class, and functional for every day use. The battery status is low and the fingerprint reader is lousy, but it is 2 unimportant functions to me.It's a laptop to recommend in its entirety.",4

1424,Huawei,"Products with high cost performance This laptop can complete daily learning and entertainment games, and it runs smoothly. It has been used for almost a month without instability or crash. Now it is very convenient to carry around Very satisfied",5
1425,Huawei,"Great product for remote classes I bought this laptop for my 3rd grade daughter to continue her remote classes in summer vacation. We compared several low-end products and chose this product. Overall, the laptop worked very well for our purpose and totally worth the price. The laptop is not heavy and the battery lasts long. The 14-inch monitor provided clear and vivid display for class material – with fonts sufficiently big for kid. The hardware is effective for internet browsing, video streaming, Microsoft Office 365, Acrobat Reader as well as basic kid programming (like scratch and python). The advantage to have an operation system (Win10) is easiness to install software – which is sometimes not very straightforward in a Chromebook. When in use, this laptop generates little heat, has no fan and therefore is pretty quiet, which is good for kid’s focus.On the other hand, the hardware can be easily configured and loaded (i.e. with background monitoring software) so that the laptop cannot efficiently handle computer games – which is BRILLIANT – so that the kid can forget about computer games.",5
1426,Huawei,"Excellent Computer Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This computer is an excellent one. The material that is used to build this computer is solid.

1429,Huawei,"Enough for daily use Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I use this computer mainly to browse the web and watch youtube videos. Compared with my gaming computer, it is light, has no fan, and also with very low heat and long battery life.It is enough for daily applications such as youtube videos and web pages.Although Celeron processors cannot be compared with processors such as i7 and i5, they are sufficient for daily applications. In addition, I am satisfied with the 14-inch IPS monitor and audio system.",5
1430,Huawei,"Intel makes your life stronger The cost of choosing different laptop models ranges from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars. The key is to pay attention to the value it brings to you. Therefore, I choose a laptop with Intel processor, which can bring you the most value in terms of performance and portability. Moreover, memory provides a new method of memory and storage, which can boot and start applications quickly, smoothly and easily. It can provide all-weather battery life, and it is light and portable. It can be said,When using the new Windows 10 processor, it will be more efficient and creative, and the effect will be even more amazing. It will not only bring you the powerful functions and performance you need, but also enable you to achieve more goals and run better.",5

1444,Xiaomi,"Don't buy this for any reason! I purchased a Chuwi HeroBook 14, which is a total piece of garbage, even at their low price. The wifi connectivity was abysmal and the keyboard failed after a few months. Dealing with Chuwi’s so-called service and support was totally fruitless; they did absolutely nothing while taking forever to do it. Their response time for emails was often more than several weeks. They also wanted to charge me for a replacement keyboard which they would ship to me although the product was under warranty. They never offered to repair or replace the unit, and I would not trust them to do so. As a technology consultant, I have purchased thousands of devices for hundreds of clients, and I have sometimes had frustrating experiences with products and service, but I have never experienced such total failure as with Chuwi. I could never recommend any Chuwi product to anyone for anything.",1

1450,Xiaomi,"Small, light notebook. Perfect for on the go use. Size makes this notebook perfect for travel. Reasonably fast processor for general use, as long as you're not gaming. The battery is good for over ten hours of use once fully charged andseems to recharge fairly quick. Altogether, a good choice for most users that don't need a serious workstation. At this price point you get a machine with SSD that runs cool without the need of a fan.",4
1451,Xiaomi,Impressed I have never owned an Asus Brand PC and am quite impressed. This model is fast everything: from the startup to the graphics and sound. The fingerprint login still has issues to be worked out but works. Shipping was great no issues.,5

The USPS was contacted early the next morning and we were able to pick it up. The item itself is FABULOUS just as advertised. I apologise for my snappiness.

1478,Xiaomi,"First Chromebook a disappointment I was excited to purchase a Chromebook for the first time this summer but didn’t get a chance to try it for a weeks after purchase due to travel. Set up was super easy as advertised but much to my disappointment, the machine goes haywire and opens and closes applications one out of every three uses. Sometimes chrome zooms in and the browser window shakes. I feel like it could cause a seizure for someone. I am only using it for surfing the web a have very basic needs it can’t even meet. I am fairly tech savvy and tried basic troubleshooting plus a factory reset. Still the same issue. Unfortunately I called Amazon after the 30 day window and they said they can’t help and won’t accept an exchange. Lenovo support said they won’t replace either. I would not purchase this product again and am disappointed I can’t get a replacement after only having it for 7 weeks.",1
1479,Xiaomi,"Had it up and running within minutes! We bought this for our grandson who is starting college. I had the device unpacked and had it up and running within minutes (after connecting the charger). Worked perfectly. Great keyboard and display. Fast. Should do 99.9% of what he will need in college. I am an IT pro with decades of experience and have my own (non-Lenovo) Chromebook and I find the Chromebook is my go-to machine and there are only a few things I am not able to do on it myself. The Lenovo Chromebook seems very solid. Great price, great machine.",5
1480,Xiaomi,Does NOT support Canon some printers!!! I am not happy so far with the Chromebook. You have to go to settings every time to pin app to tool bar. Can't figure out how to add to desktop everything saves to Google drive. I had great expectations for this product but then the printer issue. In a time were you can print from almost anything that connects to Wifi this does not support Canon MX920 series. And I can NOT get through for help. Went to Lenovo site and was bounced around by a virtual assistant that did not understand need to connect to printer. I am now seeking help from Amazon customer service. Hopefully I will have a more positive update in the coming days. But honestly I should have stayed clear of this went with another PC product.,2
1481,Xiaomi,Amazing condition Ipad was way cleaner then expected i bought a used one off best buy and it was so scratched up you couldn’t even see what you where looking at THIS IPAD WAS PERFECT!! 👍🏼 I got it for my nephew and he loves it barely any scratches,5

1486,Xiaomi,"Flaky From the Start I should have returned the device as soon as I received it because it initially had problems turning on. But, my son had already seen it and couldn't let it go. So, I worked with it until it finally came on and stayed on. Worked well, but it continued to be a pain to turn on from time to time. Then, an issue with wi-fi connectivity started occurring. I tried all the online tips for getting the wi-fi to turn on. Got it to work finally. Wi-fi button went out again and I have not been able to reconnect for over 6 months. Just coming up on a year and it's already dead. Sooooo mad and disappointed!",2

1491,Xiaomi,Light weight and works It's light weight and works fine. An older computer took forever to wake up after closing the lid. This one wakes up much faster. Just be aware it has no cd/DVD drive. Is you need one you'll need an R eternal drive.,4

Apps crash so easily, and it lags. Touch screen is good, but when you use a pen it's always wobbly lines so i don't recommend drawing with it unless you like squiggly lines. Honestly, just get a tablet with a keyboard, it would work much better.",2
1502,Xiaomi,Awesome tablet! Great tablet for my needs. Add a keyboard and you'll forget it's not a laptop! My ONLY complaint is the inability to run apps. .... A flash would be nice too but I don't use it to take pictures.,5

1507,Xiaomi,This Surface does everything I hoped it would! This Surface is lightweight and very portable.It's a computer and a tablet all in one. I'm still learning about all it's features. I love it!,5
1508,Xiaomi,"A portable Windows computer / tablet for light work I was expecting to receive this Surface Go 2 for quite some time, and I'm really pleased with it so far. This is the latest model with the M3 processor and the 8GB of RAM, and with the addition LTE slot. Still, it's not powerful and does not come to replace any workhorse workstation - for this I have a dedicated PC at home. I chose the Surface Go 2 for portability when I'm on the go and away from my main computer, and also because it's a tablet that runs Windows that gives me the freedom of Windows, and the touch and pen support for working on my Windows software and tools; things that I couldn't have done with my iOS and Android devices.I'm also enjoying (finally!) watching YouTube videos, without the annoying ads within videos and all over the place; thanks to the fact that it's a Windows machine(!) and all the Adblocker browser plugins work without any fuss - plugins that just aren't supported on the YouTube mobile app on either iOS or Android devices. I have tablets of both vendors and frankly, I never enjoyed watching YouTube videos on them due to the fact that Adblocker plugins just aren't supported on them. I really can't describe more in words - it's just the freedom of a Windows machine.Again, it's not a powerful device and it does not meant to be. If you take its limitations in advanced and aiming this device for working on light tasks that it can handle then you're going to enjoy it. For me, besides of the fun of browsing the web and watching videos 'ads free', I wanted a Windows based drawing tablet for running Aseprite (a pixel art editor) and Clickteam Fusion (a 2D game creation engine) for desktop computers. With this device I finally can, along with the most important thing of being on the go. And when I need more processing power I can always go and use my main computer, while I could also have the Surface Go 2 as a secondary monitor for it in-case I'd need touch and pen support.Pros:- Fanless tablet that makes no noise whatsoever; see 'cons' section below regarding heat.- Great resolution and aspect ratio of 1920 x 1280.- Gorgeous display with rich colors and contrast.- Reasonable speakers for a tablet in this size.- Great webcam with great microphone either for video chats or voice recording.- Flexible and very usable kick-stand.- The Surface Pen (not included) works great and it's very satisfying in software that supports pressure sensitivity.- The charger is 100-240V, so you can use it anywhere in the world with a simple wall outlet adapter.Cons:- Only 128GB of SSD; buy a MicroSD card in advanced. I picked a 512GB one for storage.- It gets VERY HOT! Especially when drawing. I have a sensitive skin and while drawing it really felt like burning at the side of my palm when I reached the center-top of the screen (probably where the processor is located). I'm thinking of buying the drawing glove that goes over the side of the palm and over 2 fingers. Maybe it will make the heat less annoying.- Only a single USB Type-C port; since it's a single port it may get loose and worn-out during time of connecting and disconnecting devices to it. So I picked in advanced a magnetic USB Type-C connector which has a female USB Type-C at the other end of the magnet. So I keep the male connector always connected to the port and I do all the connections on the detachable female end of the magnet.- Arrives with Windows 10 Home in S mode; meaning you can't install anything on it apart from whatever's on the Microsoft Store. But this is switchable to a full Windows 10 Home from within the operating system. Just note that once you move out of S mode you can't go back to it - it's a one-way thing but you're probably going to do it anyway as being stuck with S mode is like being stuck with iOS which is limited only to Appel's AppStore apps. And we want the freedom of Windows. :) Just make sure you restart your Surface after the switch, or else you'd find that the device works very slow. After restart it runs normal.- The battery is okay. It's not an iPad despite the price tag, so don't expect it to behave like one. Windows devices running under Intel processors tend to consume more from the battery. And hence draining it quicker than other ARM based devices. But you can help to make it last longer if you close apps you don't use and decreasing the brightness of the display from the maximum.- The charger is a US kind which goes directly into the wall outlet. Since it's 100-240V I'd expected it to be a power brick with 2 line cables; one permanent that goes to the Surface, and the other one which can be detached in order to be replaced with a cable suitable for different regions. At least it can be used with a simple wall outlet adapter.*The Type Keyboard, Pen and Mouse shown in the last picture are not included with the Surface Go 2. They are sold separately. I only shared the picture here for those who'd like to see how the black set looks like.",4

1511,Xiaomi,"Incredible graphics People use their laptops for different purposes, so I'll state mine right away. I write novels, I watch movies, and I edit film montages. I do not play games, nor do I use multiple programs at a time for work.So, for my purposes, this Dell XPS laptop is fantastic. You'll have to see it to believe how tiny and thin it is, which could be a pro or con depending on your point of view. Pro is it's easily transported, either around the house or traveling. Con is if you are watching a movie, it's a small screen. The keyboard is easy to use, and the touchpad is large. I'm still getting used to the touch screen, as it's very foreign to me. But then again, I'm also still getting used to the automatically installed Alexa and fingerprint scanning on/off button. Times are changing.As two of my three primary uses involves graphics, I'm extremely pleased. When I'm editing, I can really see the detail and there are no 'freeze ups' as my older computer would have. Movies seem like they're in high definition. The contrast in colors, (or if you pop in an old black-and-white noir) is really intense.As always, know what you're looking for in a laptop. If you're primary motivation is RAM, speed, graphics, size, etc, then look up what will be best for you. I'm a huge fan of Dell computers, and I expect this one to last as long as my last one (five years, and it didn't really die, I was just ready for an upgrade). The battery life is great, and even though the cords look a little weird in the box, you'll figure it out. My biggest con is the lack of ports, namely USB and HDMI, but you can't have everything. This is perfect for the traveler. Charge it up, watch a great movie on the airplane, and it won't weigh down or take up much room in your carry-on bag.",5

1513,Xiaomi,"Beast of a travel laptop! At this screen size, which is just a bit larger than the premium tablets from Apple and Samsung, this is a laptop designed for travel.Because of the metal body it is not as light as some other laptops of similar size, but the build quality feels so much better.I absolutely love that they didn't scrimp on the hard drive and gave you a decent size.With an i7 processor and 16GB of RAM this laptop can handle audio and video processing while doing standard business and casual work at the same time.This is a premium laptop (at a premium price) designed to do serious heavy lifting, but I do wonder that all this power is in a laptop that is this size and obviously geared toward business travelers -- unless it's just for executives that want to have the latest and greatest for their PowerPoint presentations.Still, attached to a docking station with a large monitor, this will power through work and play.I've had no issues with the WiFi at all and this is only connected via WiFi in my setup.Dell is often thought of as the ""worker bee"" laptop company, but this laptop is more for queen bees.Very, very impressed.",5

1515,Xiaomi,"Lightweight & great sound & color make this a nice computer... This teeny, tiny computer is so thin & lightweight, it practically fits in a manila envelope. I was able to get it set up fairly easily. I’m switching from a laptop that uses a touchpad or mouse & this has a touch screen. I’m going back & forth between computers to get everything set up & I prefer a mouse over a touchpad. Such a simple thing but it sure wastes time when you forget which device uses which.But on to this really nice Dell laptop. First, this thing is so lightweight. I always travel with my laptop & flying with this one that’s easy to slip into a slightly oversized purse & is extremely lightweight has improved traveling for me.The speakers have a nice clear sound so it was a winner in my book. I can’t always hear things very well & actually have a new flatscreen I’m ready to pitch out the door because it sounds like mush. No one else has that problem with it so I think it’s me but that doesn’t make me able to hear it any better. I hear everything just fine with this computer. I really enjoy that.I like the back lighting that makes it easy to use in a dark room. I don’t have a glare with this computer.Probably the best part for me is the OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diodes) that emit their own light when an electric current is passed through rather than having an external light source for brightness. The resulting colors are vibrant & crisp; good for watching things like YouTube & Netflix or Skyping & photoshopping. I can be doing what I want, watching what I want & I’m not disturbing anyone else in the room. I’m enjoying darker darks, lighter lights, brighter colors & have an excellent viewing experience. I didn’t realize what I was missing until I started watching it on this computer.It’s expensive to have that technology but this computer will last for years. It has a crazy long lifespan, the battery lasts around 6 hours before needing charged. I’m not a technology genius; all I can say is what I like & I like this computer. It’s tempting to get new games to see how much the graphics improve but I don’t need to do that. My husband, though, is very excited to use this computer for flight programs. I told him I’d think about it.",4

I tried every possible fix on forums to no avail. I even reached out to Intel technical support who manufacturer the ""Killer Wi-Fi"" cards for Dell. He said the name is befitting because ever since buying the Killer network company it's been nothing but nonstop issues and there is no fix.Don't believe me?

1520,Xiaomi,"everything good but beware OLED display Yes, this is a wonderful laptop and the display is stunning. But what Dell and OLED TV sellers won't tell you about is the unspoken pitfalls of OLED technology. Yes, they do provide the clearest, most stunning display of any screen technology. What they don't warn you about is after approximately 10k hours of use the OLED technology will result in irreversible burn-in, especially if any image, particularly red or green, is left static on the screen repeatedly. Since most laptop users keep their laptops on, or default to their desktops for extended periods, or are working spreadsheets for hours on end, or are using them for extended periods of time with the same parts of the screen remaining static for extended periods of time, a burn it will invariably result. It won't MIGHT happen...it WILL happen. This burn in is not correctable...the entire display needs to be replaced. For instance, if you use Facebook a lot and there are red dots on any of the icons on top of the page, and you don't click on them, it will result in a burn-in after an extended exposure. I have dealt with this twice on my LG 55"" OLED 4k SMART television. I enjoyed the best looking TV screen for approximately 10k hours of use and then POW...overnight I started seeing burn in from the ""Breaking News"" banners from CNN and from other programs which I watched all the time that had static images, such as their station logo in one of the corners; or if I had one of the TV's HDMI inputs set to my computer and I left the desktop on all the time with no screen saver activated. Luckily for me, my 5-year warranty protected me, but the same thing happened all over again. Since I also used my LG OLED 4k Smart TV as my computer monitor, I installed a screen saver on my computer that activates after 30 seconds so there is never the possibility of a burn in in case I accidently leave an image on the TV when it is displaying anything static from my computer. Any time I pause a TV program I am watching, I immediately switch the HDMI input to my computer and the screen saver kicks on in under 30 seconds as long as I don't move the mouse....hence no static image, which means no burn in. This is why OLED screens are not recommended for computer use, but are terrific for TV use PROVIDED YOU HAVE A COMPUTER WITH AN ACTIVATED 30-SECOND SCREEN SAVER ATTACHED THROUGH ONE OF THE TV'S HDMI INPUTS. My computer is still attached to my OLED TV. but when I use it now, I never go to a website that keeps a static image; I always have my 30-second screen saver activated; and I never leave the desktop static on my computer. Until the manufacturers solve the burn-in issues of OLED technology, it is safer to use QLED technology when it becomes available for laptops and computer monitors. OLED...great for TV's....not safe for computers yet.",3
1521,Xiaomi,"Great for the price I had to find a replacement computer pretty fast.This laptop isn't the same as my gaming laptop that I had, however it is a prettynice buy esp if you are on a budget.I use this laptop for many different functions, from skyping to, art , toplaying games on it. I am not an avid gamer that does hard core gaming so I don't really put that much stress on my lappy.It was on sale when I bought it , so it has been a very nice buy. My husband recommended it because it is what he uses .So far it has been a great investment.The colors that the cam picks up are not true to color , but it isn't super off , and it doesn't affect any other functionality to the laptop.I use an external hard drive for various functions such as games or art work, which is nice .It is a decent size and not super bulky. I would recommend esp if you are on a budget and don't have 3K plus to put into a monster machine.I would suggest it also for kids wanting a decent gaming computer that they can also do work on.It did lose a star for the cam .Overall though it is pretty much a really great buy esp for the price.",5
1522,Xiaomi,"Good gaming computer, electricity hungry We are really pleased with this machine. Good solid computer. Got it as a gift for my 16byr old, but I'm a gamer myself, and it's just a good solid machine, multiplayer FPS, no problem. Standard or high settings. The one negative thing is the power brick that comes with it. It's huge, and the capacitors inside it must be monstrous. We tried running it on a 1000 watt inverter (off grid), and it tripped the breakers every time we plugged the power brick in, even when it wasn't connected to the computer. That's....a lot of electricity. It pulls a lot. If you're not off grid like us, that's probably not much of a factor. But even off grid, it's gonna pull a lot of electricity compared to two other gaming laptops we have in the house. But, I mean, gaming is an electricity-heavy pastime, so, maybe that's just par for the course.",4

They removed 1 of the ram slots and 1 is now soldered on so both ram sticks can't be upgraded like the Ryzen 3 3200u version. I was under the impression that both slots were upgradable since Acer America replied to 2 customer questions saying that both memory slots are upgradable but they likely were taking about another version that was listed. This led me to spend $70 extra for 2 8gb sticks that I didn't need. Also the battery isn't even screwed in!,1

In fact I wish manufacturers would make their more powerful (CPU) models available in Windows S for use cases such as young and old less tech savvy people that still want to edit pictures and videos.However - this model by Acer has an issue that is disappointing. All edges match perfectly, so it is quite difficult to open! There is no indent to separate the clamshell. Very very weird as an outcome from designers in todays age.==== FYI ====Aspire 5 A515-46-R14K / AMD Ryzen 3 3350U / 4GB / 128GB1) This model has 1 open DDR Ram slot. I put an 8GB unit it in for a new total of 12GB.2) This model has a completely empty 2.5"" hard disk slot to accept an SSD. The drive mount and connection wire come separately in the box (which I found odd).3) The internal drive is a user replaceable M.2 drive.4) Rear panel removes easily by removing rear screws and carefully and evenly prying the seam with plastic phone pry bar.ADVICE FOR ACER5) Acer, please make an indent to allow for easy opening.6) Please sell better CPU's with Windows-S and larger built-in RAM. Would be nice to have an i5/i7 with 16GB of ram for young people or old people, less tech savvy that want to edit their videos on the laptops.7) There is space the the left of the battery and under the optional SSD area that is empty.

I also love the screen, it's big and everything is clear, brightness can be adjusted (see picture for good screen quality). This laptop works fast. It is Intel celeron which of course isn't the best but for the value, it works well and I believe it is worth it. I easily installed google chrome, and anything else I need, including Zoom, apps ,etc. The best part though for me, is the micro SD slot. My other laptop does not have this feature and I had been so sad about it so I found this one and it has it! I now can easily can transfer my videos from my sony camcorder to the laptop and edit them. The speed of the laptop is not a problem thus far, and seems to be faster than my 10 month old Acer laptop. I like that there is no brand name on the laptop too, so I can easily apply a laptop skin without feeling like I'm covering any brand name haha. I don't like brands in general. And this fits the bill for value laptop with no brand. I like the size of the keyboard and the mouse pad in the middle is huge!Cons: The only con I can think of right now is the camera quality. It is grainy and could be better at this time of so many technological advancements. So I wouldn't use this computer to do video chats, but I have my other laptop for that reason (work).Overall, this computer works fast and perfectly for my needs as a computer to keep track of my hobbies, edit videos (you can get your own video editor too), and entrepreneuring creations.

1587,Xiaomi,"Tried to set up but would not get past logo, return?? Did not work upon arrival, attempted to return, return was cancelled on their end after date of acceptable return so it was considered invalid",1
1588,Xiaomi,This is great This is excellent I would buy another one,5
1589,Xiaomi,No screen touch For thw fact that I sent over $600 it should have a touch! Other than that its great:),4
1590,Xiaomi,Go get one! I like the size & weight.Colors on the screen are bright.I am pleased. Out 'tech guy' who transferred xata from my old laptop to this ASUS was really impressed.He may buy one for himself.,5
1591,Xiaomi,"Amazing for school I have been using this for about a year now and I am in love. I wish I had gone with the i7 only for the faster processing, but even with the i5 it still gets what I need done. Considering that most of my schoolwork is done through Canvas and Cloud, the 256GB SSD is perfect for school. Don't forget to add this to your tax write offs, too, kids! Save yourself some bucks and get something top notch, or something light and portable, like this. Sometimes my fiancée will end up taking this to work solely for the portability factor over her macbook.",5
1592,Xiaomi,Perfect Great purchase. Works exactly for my needs.,5
1593,Xiaomi,Crashed twice The product was great at first then all of a sudden just a black screen. Hour later and repeated button combinations finally got a screen.Weeks later same thing but still no screen. Returned it!,1
1594,Xiaomi,"Not a genuine Microsoft type cover. The computer is great. The type cover is not a genuine Microsoft keyboard, and has to be plugged in with a usb cable.",4
1595,Xiaomi,"Love my SP4 and REALLY love my SP7! What a great computer. I use the dock and with one plug I'm charging and using two huge monitors for work and I have the SP7's display to keep CNBC streaming and in view. The SSD is fast as lightning.Some will comment that these machines are not upgradeable, which isn't completely true...but it's not easy to do and most shops won't pry it open and do a repair or an upgrade, but they are out there. My advice is to buy the top of the line configuration so you don't need to upgrade it anytime soon.The pen is helpful when I show clients graphs and want to highlight something on the graph, but that's the only time I use it. The screen is too slick for note taking to feel comfortable, although you can buy a matte screen protector that creates a little paper-like drag on the screen.The keyboard isn't bad for when you're traveling, but it bounces a little and I certainly wouldn't use it for daily use. I have a wireless surface extended keyboard as well as a surface mouse...Battery life is great if you keep the screen brightness and processor set to lower usage.The WIFI card in the SP7 is quite an upgrade compared to the SP4 I had. I get 400Mbps down when I'm in the same room as my gigabit router.The only thing I've added to the SP7, which is the flat black model, is a flat black skin for the back to prevent scratches when travelling. It's a cheap way to protect your SP7 and doesn't change the look or thickness.The reason I upgraded from the SP4 to the SP7 was a ram requirement. I only had 4Mb of Ram in the SP4 and Windows 10 really needs about 10Mb of free ram to work well. Do get the 16Mb version if you decide to buy this laptop.... you'll be glad you spent the extra money.If this review was helpful, please indicate it below. Thanks!",5
1596,Xiaomi,"Product is DEAD on arrival; does not work, never worked, never turned on or booted up This product gets zero stars but that is not a rating choice.The product was completely DEAD after I took it out of the box and plugged it in. The power up button does not do anything.The screen never lights up.The light on the power connector shows as green so the laptop is plugged into power correctly.However,I waited hours and then overnight and nothing changed.It still dos not respond to the power on switch.It has NEVER worked.I have no idea how to send it back and get a new one.Since it was not an amazon product I was given the run around.A robot voice answered my call for help.Can anyone help replace the lemon Pro with one that can boot up?Thanks for listening.",1
1597,Xiaomi,"What the heck!?! I like the surfaces generally, but what I paid for was a new Surface, not a used Surface with an off brand type cover! Super not happy! It's also irritating that it took a full week to have it arrive used.... Not happy with seller! Not cool! It's not even like they were mistaken either, the type cover doesn't even fit in the box- it wasn't even fully closed. They just stuffed the ghetto type cover in there.",1
1598,Xiaomi,"Keyboard included is a cheap knockoff, not Microsoft As indicated in the title, the description points to this item including an authentic Microsoft Surface Pro Type Cover (and also pictured). Instead, what comes with it is a cheap knockoff keyboard called ""Moko"". Not happy with this bait and switch",1
1599,Xiaomi,"Excellent computer!!! I love my surface pro, the battery does last for a long period of time and it' s very light to carry it around!!!",5
1600,Xiaomi,SO GLAD I DIDNT GET ANOTHER MACBOOK Wow. So incredible. I had no idea they make computers this badass. why did i have a macbook air?? that was dumb. bill gates really outdid himself on this one,5
1601,Xiaomi,"Marvelous for most uses. Best bang for the buck of any computer purchase in the last three decaded. This thing is rubberized. Water resistant. Instant on. Ten hours battery life. Nice key travel. Small size. Perfect for most uses: Facebook, writing, websites, etc. The bang for the buck is unreal.",5
1602,Xiaomi,"ORDERED NEW, BUT USED LAPTOP SENT INSTEAD! The headline says it all.Ordered a NEW ASUS Chromebook C202 Laptop. Instead a USEDone was delivered.It is being returned!",1
1603,Xiaomi,Perfect for school work This computer isn't touch screen. It is a perfect computer for school work though. I use this for college and love it. The battery life on this computer is also amazing.,5
1604,Xiaomi,"Good Chromebook Light, fast, durable.",5
1605,Xiaomi,"overall a great buy I'd always had Apple products, but needed something lighter and easier to travel with.This Asus was perfect in those regards.I don't find the higher keyboard a drawback.I learned to type in 1963 on an upright Royal manual, so have experienced a wide variety of keyboards.As I'm a bit older now (70s) I really do need a little more light at the keyboard.I agree with the reviewer who suggested that even phosphorescent numbering would be a help.My only complaint is the plastic cover for the hinge.Mine keeps falling off.While it doesn't affect performance, it does mean that the hinge ""catches"" on things and is very unattractive.The screen is a bit small for me at this point, but that's the trade off with weight and convenience.All in all, I remain very satisfied (except for the hinge cover!) after nearly four years of use--certainly a great buy for kids and students.",4
1606,Xiaomi,"Perfect for what I wanted I bought this for my author work with the intention of only using it for web browsing and writing software. It is perfect for those uses. It handles many tabs at admirable loading speeds. I can multitask like a boss and the storage is larger than I expected. After a couple years with this laptop, I still would never think of getting a different one. It serves my needs perfectly. If you are thinking about this laptop, just know that it can only run Chrome OS which is different from Windows and Apple OS. It is pretty safe against viruses, but you have to wipe your local storage to remove any. Not a big hassle for me, and I save images and downloads on an external hard drive.",5
1607,Xiaomi,"Best purchase of my life My friends spend more money on their laptops than I spent on my car. Meanwhile, I bought this laptop for $165 4 years ago and it still runs like a champ. I drop it all the time, I've spilled water on it, and nothing stops it. It has no bloatware because it's basically just a browser, and you can disable all of the other apps from the Play store. You can run Linux on it for gaming if you put it in developer mode. It's like one of those laptops they send to kids in Africa because they're indestructible, but it still manages to be useful for a heavy internet user degenerate Westerner like me.The only issue I've had is that the charger is a little wonky now and it can be a little fiddly to get a good connection now. But it's had heavy use daily for 4 years so I think that's perfectly fair.Even for the current price of $300+ I'd probably buy it again. God I wish it was still <$200 though. Hey Google, if you want me to be your spokesperson for Chromebooks, let me know! You can pay me in Asus C202s.",5
1608,Xiaomi,"Disappointed This computer was purchased last April for my son to use for mobile learning. It was easy for him to navigate through, and it seemed to hold its charge well. By December is started to give trouble, but after restarting it, it was fine. In late February of this year, the screen just went blank in the middle of him doing school work. I contacted the seller just to see if they had any pointers. I attempted to contact them via email 3 times within a few weeks (trying to give them some time). Nothing. I wasn't asking for a refund or replacement. I just wanted advice. I should have listened to the reviews that said the product wouldn't last.",2
1609,Xiaomi,"One of the best investments ever I need to preface this with saying that when I bought this computer in September of 2018, it was only ~$200. I see that the price has gone up since then.Nevertheless, in my 2 years and 9 months with this computer, it has not showed signs of slowing down. I am a full-time college student, and I think that is probably the perfect use for this computer. I type this as I have about 15 tabs open in another window for an essay I'm doing. Battery life isn't awesome when I do things like that, but it could be a lot worse. For $200 over nearly 3 years, this computer has given me more value than my old macbook ever did. I would like to thank whoever made such a cheap, yet durable product.If you're someone like me who gets by with google docs, sheets, etc. and only uses their laptop to pay bills, do taxes, write essays, study, attend zoom meetings, and other regular adults tasks, this is the perfect computer for you.",5
1610,Xiaomi,Chrome book Love my chrome book. Haven’t explored total uses yet . Just use for zoom meetings and email. Dependable. Recommend,5
1611,Xiaomi,A waste of money I brought this for my son for gaming and it stopped working within 2 weeks. A huge waste of money.,1

1625,Xiaomi,"Great product for remote classes I bought this laptop for my 3rd grade daughter to continue her remote classes in summer vacation. We compared several low-end products and chose this product. Overall, the laptop worked very well for our purpose and totally worth the price. The laptop is not heavy and the battery lasts long. The 14-inch monitor provided clear and vivid display for class material – with fonts sufficiently big for kid. The hardware is effective for internet browsing, video streaming, Microsoft Office 365, Acrobat Reader as well as basic kid programming (like scratch and python). The advantage to have an operation system (Win10) is easiness to install software – which is sometimes not very straightforward in a Chromebook. When in use, this laptop generates little heat, has no fan and therefore is pretty quiet, which is good for kid’s focus.On the other hand, the hardware can be easily configured and loaded (i.e. with background monitoring software) so that the laptop cannot efficiently handle computer games – which is BRILLIANT – so that the kid can forget about computer games.",5
1626,Xiaomi,"Excellent Computer Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This computer is an excellent one. The material that is used to build this computer is solid. It is very quick to turn on the system. It’s keyboard is solid, too. Its weight is light. Its dimension is thin. Battery life is about three hours when I use it nonstop. Overall, excellent computer in this price. Highly recommended.",5
1627,Xiaomi,Good laptop Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Excellent laptop. Lightning fast on start-up and changing from app to app or from different URL's.

Compared with my gaming computer, it is light, has no fan, and also with very low heat and long battery life.It is enough for daily applications such as youtube videos and web pages.Although Celeron processors cannot be compared with processors such as i7 and i5, they are sufficient for daily applications. In addition, I am satisfied with the 14-inch IPS monitor and audio system.",5
1630,Xiaomi,"Intel makes your life stronger The cost of choosing different laptop models ranges from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars. The key is to pay attention to the value it brings to you. Therefore, I choose a laptop with Intel processor, which can bring you the most value in terms of performance and portability. Moreover, memory provides a new method of memory and storage, which can boot and start applications quickly, smoothly and easily. It can provide all-weather battery life, and it is light and portable. It can be said,When using the new Windows 10 processor, it will be more efficient and creative, and the effect will be even more amazing. It will not only bring you the powerful functions and performance you need, but also enable you to achieve more goals and run better.",5

I am highly impressed with the quality of the Vera Bradley large weekender bag. I also love the floral print, which makes it easy to spot your bag when traveling. Best purchase for a great price. The shipping was quick as well. If you are debating about getting the medium or large, I would say go with the large for extra storage.",5
1633,Vero,Love love love! ❤️❤️❤️ Love love love,5
1634,Vero,Great product The product is very durable and great for travel it’s light weight and made out of cotton which makes it easy to keep clean,5
1635,Vero,"Durable and large Usually Vera Bradley bags have prints on them. So when I saw the solid collection I had to grab one. The bag is bigger than I expected- one zippers pocket on the front side, two pockets on either side, and a large mesh pocket on the inside divided into 3. The material feels very thick and durable. It also has an extendable strap if you want to wear it across your body and two straps if you want to put it on your shoulder. I went a way a couple days and packed everything I need in the duffle. It can also be used as a carry on. The color is an orangy- pink. Very bright and it can be washed in the washing machine. The bag itself is pretty lightweight.",5
1636,Vero,Love it Looking forward to use for traveling soon,5
1637,Vero,"Great Weekender Bag This is a very well made, roomy weekender bag by Vera Bradley. Although her bags are soft and often made of recycled or regular cotton, they are sturdy. This bag can hold enough clothes for a weekend as it spreads wide and is deep and you don't even have to worry about traveling light. The bag shape is basic and the pattern is very cute with the soft blues and purples. I'm excited for my next weekend away and always suggest to make the investment in a Vera Bradley bag because they are really well made and will last you forever.",4
1638,Vero,"Large, pretty, interior pockets lacking for size This is a large duffle and will work for a longer trip.I have the quilted Rain Forest Canopy version and I prefer the quilted and love the colors and design of this version.I like the pretty coordinating interior lining.I find the slick solid fabrics of these pick up dirt a lot easier.This bag is generous but is floppy.Since there is no structure, packed items may not stay neat and organized inside.This would benefit from using packing bags inside.The interior pockets are not very generous.For example, I like to use side pockets for underwear, bras, and socks, etc. and these are not big enough to hold all that I- may bring.I would also not, personally, check this bag for a flight.I think it could get torn or damaged easily and would worry about the items inside if anything was breakable like hair tools, toiletries, etc..I will use this for road trips and I like it for that.",4

1649,Vero,"Perfect for grad school, 15"" macbook pro + iPad + notebooks! I don't use it often, only when my laptop needs to go from home to work or vis versa, but I've loved it. I have a 2011 15"" macbook pro. That thing is hefty, and it fits perfectly in this bag. The side pockets held my power cable and presentation adapters, as well as notebooks, pens, and occasionally my iPad. This bag has no signs of wear or tear after all this time. It's sleek and beautiful and I love that you can carry it as a briefcase, or use the shoulder strap. Highly recommend!",5
1650,Vero,"Great way to class up work laptop During the pandemic/WFH, my work laptop took quite a beating. It fell off the couch at one point and got a large scratch across the top. Still functions fine, but looks sad. I slapped this on, and it looks better than ever! Highly recommend.",5

1655,Vero,Not what I expected🤦🏾‍♀️ This comes in sheets and is not precut..I suck at cutting things out soooo let’s just say it didn’t go well. I expected it to be precut because it asks what size you need...uggghhh now I have to find something else.,1
1656,Vero,"Not what I expected… All the reviews I read were positive. However, when I opened mine, the print was very grainy and pixilated. When I tried cutting it to size to fit my laptop, it just wouldn’t work. The adhesive was alright and it was not too terrible to remove but became less sticky each time you would peel off to refit. Overall, not for me but could work for someone else.",2
1657,Vero,"High Quality and Gorgeous!😍😍😍 This laptop skin is so pretty! The colors are very vibrant! It matches my red laptop perfectly! It is really easy to apply and then readjust if you need to move it around a bit while you are putting it on. It lays down smoothly and stays on very well. And it definitely helps protect from moisture, dust and scratches! The company's customer service is awesome at addressing any issues as well! I highlyrecommend and I will be purchasing from here in the future! 👍👍👍",5
1658,Vero,"Eh.... Eh??? It wasn't hard to cut to size but since the pattern is swirly I didn't notice the fairly long pre-existing scratch on it until after it was cut and I was putting it on my laptop. Never fun to have a damaged new item... The pattern is ok, though not as vibrantly colored as I hoped. I will probably replace this pretty soon.",2
1659,Vero,Nice product A little too big but fits when properly cut,5
1660,Vero,"Pretty and functional Well made. Holds a lot. Cute pattern. Only thing I don’t love is that the zipper cover flap makes it hard to open and close, and if you flip it up the pattern isn’t on the other side. Otherwise just what I was looking for.",5

1665,Vero,Not bad but not great Bag is nice looking but doesn't look like the one in the pictures. The gold color parts are not shiny and just looks dull. The shoulder strap does not strap on the ends but it's oddly positioned in the middle where the open pockets are so it's hard to put things in and pull them out from those pockets.,3

1706,Vero,"Cheap & flimsy Materials are cheap, thin & do not feel substantial. The carrying strap is so short that if you put the bag over your shoulder, the computer won't be at your hip or thigh, it will be at your waist. Who asked for a purse?A computer bag holds an item that is an investment of usually $500 or more. That's why the bag needs to be sturdy & give you confidence that the cargo is well protected.I wouldn't use this bag to carry a $20 book let alone a computer. The lightweight plastic clips feel like they could snap at any second. No. Keep shopping. This product is el cheapo.",1

1717,Vero,"Color is a bit off Great bag. The material is thick, even though I would prefer a bit thicker to protect my electronics. Overall it's not bad for the price, but the color is off from that in the photo. The ""wine red"" is more red (not as dark as expected).",4
1718,Vero,"Good but not dirt resistant It's good, as seen, but wished the handle was made of a different material. It gets dingy pretty quickly",4

1720,Vero,"Simply Amazing for the price For such a cheap price, you get an amazing product. The handle and case are very durable and my laptop feels very protected in there - especially when I put this case in my backpack as well.

1722,Vero,"Too Big I ordered the 16 inch case that was supposed to fit a 15.6 inch Lenovo IdeaPad. The laptop fits, but it slides all around inside of it. There's about an inch of wiggle room in either direction and the little flap intended to keep the laptop from falling out when the case is first opened doesn't secure it at all. I'm not sure that sizing down would be a good option considering the 15 inch case doesnt include my laptop as one of the ones it fits. I just think that a laptop SLEEVE should fit relatively snug. If I wanted the laptop jumbling around I could put it into any bag. The laptop case also came with crumples on the material, which is kind of ridiculous considering they shipped it in a ginormous box instead of a parcel.",3

1729,Razer,"You're not buying something for gaming you're just giving razer money for junk 1. Razer tried to steal my 3,600 dollars.Like I had to make my bank contact them and take my money back.2.

November updates basically killed the ability to stream (whole point in buying it)If you're doing prebuilds or want a laptop for convenience.Go asus.I have an asus rog with a 1060 that performs just as well.... and that's not even sort of messed up.Can only ever do 1 thing.Run game at max settings.95c 38fps.Every game though, or just YT.Less than a year old, this was definitely not my first purchase from razer.But it is the last one.",1
1730,Razer,"Keyboard/mousepad are awful, customer service is even worse Every time I use this the cursor will jump to areas on the screen that I did not intend or keys that I did not press will press on their own. I can't use it as a laptop at all as a result. For its size it has great power, but overall it misses the mark on very basic functionality. When I asked customer service for an exchange at the discounted price I bought it at, they wouldn't do it. Will not be buying a Razer product ever again.",2
1731,Razer,"Powerful but Hot and Sensitive In terms of this machine's performance in running daily tasks or playing games at high settings, I didn't have any issues. However, there are two issues that made it almost exceedingly annoying to use at times:The first has to do with the heat levels on the palm rest. While not much of an issue while browsing the internet or other basic tasks, if you happen to be gaming or doing anything that demands more power, the palm rest area can get hot enough to be very uncomfortable and even slightly painful.The second issue is the palm rejection on the touchpad. The touchpad is nice and large and is easy to use, but even on the lowest sensitivity settings, you will frequently find as you are typing on a word document that your cursor randomly moves up several lines or a paragraph is deleted because the touchpad registered the slightest whiff of your palm as you were typing.One minor issue that is probably obvious to anyone purchasing this device is that it is a fingerprint magnet. If that bothers you, just be prepared to be cleaning it a lot.",3
1732,Razer,"Might be a great computer... only the person who stole it knows for sure. Ah, the delightful anticipation of awaiting a new computer after agonizing, debating and weighing the options.And then, the eagerly awaited unboxing... only to find a package of paper rather than the $2,400 computer we thought we purchased.Whoever stole our computer, I hope you'll write in and let us know if it was worth the money or not.",1
1733,Razer,Amazing laptop but bought at wrong time Of course 2 months after I buy it the razer 15 3080 comes out. Still an amazing laptop. It gets loud.,4
1734,Razer,great for gaming but low battery life Bought for my daughter for her gaming and she loves it. The games no longer have any lag or clipping which was triggering her vertigo. Her only complaint is that when playing any game that she only gets around 2 hours of battery use so she keeps it on the charger when its on.,4
1735,Razer,"Love these laptops Bought 2 of the 2080/1TB version and we are really enjoying them. I would think most people would know this, but this is a very thin and powerful laptop, so it is going to have high thermals, I would recommend using a laptop cooler as a stand for it. The build quality is great, the attention to details like the keyboards and software are great. I am really struggling to try to find something negative to say about this laptop. Maybe the price but I feel like if you are in the market for a clean/quality gaming laptop (or hard-working work laptop) with an aluminum finish, you are looking at this price tag already. Razer I think really nailed it with this laptop.",5
1736,Razer,"Not a dude who stays cool... I am sure you’ve watched enough YouTube reviews on this unit. Coming from a 2017 Acer Predator 17 with 7700 and 1070M, I just want to say that it has much more power BUT it also heats up significantly fast. Nice little power plant for creativity and gaming for sure.",4
1737,Razer,"Nvidia Driver Issues for the past 6 months Please do not buy Razer laptops. They have an issue with the latest nVidia drivers that cause a black screen on boot or on resume from sleep.Razer has been ""working on it"" since July with very little success. Despite this, they've released new 30X0 laptops that suffer from the same issues.Please DO NOT buy anything from them. Buy from someone else that might actually help or care. The solution from Razer is to not use the fast refresh screen mode, so you're stuck at 60hz.Please, don't do it. Go with someone else.",1

1740,Razer,"A really good well built laptop but it should've com with Windows Hello or a Fingerprint Reader. I was leery of buying a laptop from Amazon as I saw many negative reviews about damaged or unfunctional laptops. Pulling the plug on a big purchase like this and worrying about receiving damaged goods is very disconcerting. However, I'm very happy to report there were no issues with my Razor Blade 15 base Oled with the i7-10750H (6 cores) CPU,16gigs of ram, 512 GB SSD and the 2070 max Q graphics card. I really love how this laptop looks! It's so beautiful! The stealth matte black, unibody construction and CNC machined aluminum is aesthetically pleasing to look at every time. This laptop is well built. The keyboard is great to type on and you'll learn the keyboard fast. Touchpad is large and great to use. Game play is good with the Oled 60hbut if you're looking for a higher refresh rate you have to go with the other base models with the 120 hz or 144 hz refresh rates. Movies look great on this Oled screen, you'll enjoy streaming on netflix. So far I haven't experienced burn in but we'll see overtime. While gaming the laptop does get hot but so do all gaming laptops. This laptop doesn't come with windows hello or a fingerprint reader which is really lame especially for a laptop in this price range $1799 to $2299. My MSI GS66 gaming laptop has window hello and logging in is super fast. You'll have to type in a password every time you log into this laptop. Ram is upgradable to 64 gigs and there is a 2nd M.2 NVME slot to add more storage. Battery life is about 4.5 to 5 hours. Overall this laptop has been performing well with no issues but only time will tell. If your considering this laptop make sure you get this on sale $1799 or cheaper. I believe its $1749 now on amazon. The 2021 Razer Blade base models no longer come with the Oled screens. You'll have to get the advanced model for over $3000 dollars. This is a really good laptop but you should also check out the competition.",4
1741,Razer,Beautiful I love my Razer.,5
1742,Razer,"Worked great for 8 months No problems for 8 months, then all of the sudden the wi-fi network adapter quit working. (Seems the hardware physically disconnected, but I don't have the time rn to take it in to the shop because I need a computer for work.) That right there is the single deal breaker. Other than that, it performed about as well as a comparable MSI laptop that I broke.",1
1743,Razer,"excelent value for money i bought this in prime day for $930, it was a bargain, the laptop is great the only issue as all gaming laptops is that it gets hot when gaming for long time and can affect the perfurmance",5
1744,Razer,"Very satisfied so far I recently purchased this product as my old laptop (Dell Inspiron) decided it didn't to hold a charge anymore. Although I dont use this for gaming, I do use it for work daily. I havent noticed any negatives so far. Holds charge pretty well, and the fans arent as loud as some of the reviews I've read….but I may not be as sensitive to the fan sounds as much as some.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to others. Already convinced one workmate to purchase and he is also very satisfied so far.",5
1745,Razer,Laptop starts out great but overheats quickly The laptop is very unique and different than any other laptops I've ever had I would give an A+ to the design. The laptop version I got had a small hard drive which would definitely need upgraded one game takes up almost the whole hard drive or at least 1/3. The laptop also seems to play every game pretty well I do not get into the most high-tech games but I do play the total war Series games and it runs perfect for all those except when it overheats. It seems to overheat very quickly when you start playing a game and this causes the computer itself to freeze crash and shut itself off. And if it doesn't do all that the game usually lags uncontrollably until you give it a timeout and shut it down for a while to cool. The battery life does not last very long even if I'm just running a simple app while having it unplugged it drains fast. If I have it unplugged during a game I'm lucky to get 20 30 minutes out of it. It's quite a shame this is a very unique laptop and I really want to love it but there are issues.,3
1746,Razer,"Great quality, poor memory Want more memory but other than that it's a breed of its own runs snow runner high settings no problem and fortnite at high settings at a stable 78 to 85 fps.",5
1747,Razer,"Okay laptop but charger sucks The laptop is okay, not a bad laptop but for the price I expect everything that comes with the laptop to be worth the price but no. The charger sucks and only charges when it’s plugged in a certain way/ position, meaning it’s got a really weak connection.I returned my first one for the same reason because I thought it was just a defective charger cable/brick but the second one I got was the same way so I know it’s Razor’s problem.",3
1748,Razer,"The Bentley of Laptops Purchased directly from razer.com, as a preorder before they were released in June. I’m upgrading from a high end Alienware 15 from 2020. Couldn’t be moreImpressed.Build quality is outstanding. Screen hinges, keyboard, trackpad, overall frame is very premium and seems that it will age very well.Obviously the hardware speaks for itself. The thing is a total beastHaven’t come across anything that slows it down. Even with 4K and maxed out graphics settings.In comparison to my Alienware it actually runs cooler and has yet to thermal throttle. Do note - I did purchase small steel “feet” that I stuck onto either side of the bottom fans. This allows the laptop to be lifted about 3/4 of an inch from the surface of my laptop pad or desk.",5
1749,Razer,"Craptop This is a beautiful laptop, with an i9-11900h / 3080 and a 4K display. Have fun enjoying that when you can barely check your email. The thing freezes up every 5 seconds and doesn’t allow me to click. Whenever I try to load up any game, the laptop freezes and you have to hold the power button to hard reset it. Don’t be like me and waste your money on a laptop that can barely function as one. I would return I a heart beat. Go buy a chrome book.",1
1750,Razer,"High Quality What I use this machine for:CADD & Gaming.Pros:This machine has a stunning display (4K 60HZ Model)It can handle anything you throw at it with ease (11th gen I9 / 3080).The Razer Synapse interface is user friendly.Extremely thin for the power it brings.Room to upgrade the SSD & RAM.Cons:Battery life is bad (45 min - 2 hours depending on what you're doing). But this is expected with the size and power this machine has.Fans can get a little loud, but nothing serious.It gets hot, but not to the point where you can't touch it like some people like to exaggerate. (I ran multiple games for 6+ hours straight on full/ultra settings for my heat test).Conclusion:This thing is expensive, but in my opinion it brings a lot to the table and is worth the money. I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5, but that is not an option so I decided to round it up.",5
1751,Razer,"Issues, Issues, Issues I got this to compare and test if an upgrade is worth my money, it's the same chassis as previous Razer Blade models, with unfixed issues and severe new problems.When connected to wifi, the screen flickers, especially on the highest framerate. (360hz in my config)This does not appear to be a problem for older (2020) models at the same framerate.Battery Life is lackluster, and Razer Blade Laptop batteries are known to swell, so if you're going to use this primarily at your desk, having it plugged in and battery maintaining at 100% might not be a good idea. (disconnect the battery for long-term desk use)Razer Blade laptops are known to have the build quality on par with MacBooks, but with new hardware like the 3080, the palm rest gets unbearably hot during gaming, and sweat will start forming on the palm rest.My conclusion? This is not worth the upgrade from my 2020 model running a 10th gen CPU and 2060 GPU, perhaps the Razer Blade 14 model with AMD processors is worth the purchase, but I'm certainly regretting this purchase.",2
1752,Razer,"Updated Review: Poor Quality Control for an otherwise great looking laptop that is overall mediocre Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Updated Reivew: 8/15/2022 - Decided to give this a second chance and updated to score from 1 star to 3 stars (I would give 2.5 stars but rounded up)Buyer beware for quality control issues (screen flickering and overheating on first blade I recieved). Second Blade was also flickering but I had to downgrade the intel UHD driver. The new intel drivers that just came out a few days ago however are working fine. If you are to buy this, get it from a reputable retailer and with an extended warranty!Build Quality - very good. new coating is more finger print resistant, not 100% but a huge improvement and easy to clean.Ports: 2 USB-C Thunderbolt with power delivery, 2 USB-A, full sized HDMI, SD Card Reader, headphone jackScreen: 360/FHD - looks great, really fast. Going back to 60hz displays suck. Really wanted the 240 QHD but not available anywhere.Webcam - worst 1080 webcam I've ever used.They skimped out on this which is disappointing for a laptop at this priceSpeakers: they are horrible. Think of two mono cell phone speakers on each side, They sound hollow and tinny. Need to remove that THX sticker because it's embarrassing.Keyboard: They are OK. Key travel is decent, but I like the Zephyrus G14 a lot better and this is obviously nowhere near the MacBook line's.Mouse: I like it a lot. Large, responsive, no issues. Hard going back to another laptop trackpad and is up there with the MacBook's.Heat: Second Blade did not burn like the first one I had to return. Temps are good on productivity software. It gets in the 90s, close to 100 when gaming and the fans come on loud. Don't ever use on your lap for gaming, place on a desk. Fans come on about 45-50db and to me it's not so bad while gaming. Runs quiet on productivity so no problems in an office environment.Battery life: For productivity you will get about 5-6 hours on 75% brightness. Gaming is less than a few hours and you obviously wont get the max performance without plugging it in. Not the greatest, wish they put in a 100whr battery instead of the 80whr.Gaming Performance: Basically can run every game I through at it over 60fps even on an external 3440x1440 external display. No problem at the native 1080 display on the laptop. Control, MW, Paladins, Overwatch, Shadow of Tombraider fly on this.----I really like the design and build quality of this. However right after taking it out of the box, plugging in and powering on, the laptop was incredibly hot while running updates and installing software. It was still running hot when I was browsing the internet and then the screen started flickering. Every time I moved the mouse it flickered and the cursor got blurry. I did a restart and it went back to normal but 5 minutes later it started doing it again! I shut it down and decided to return it the next morning.The next day out of curiosity I managed to run some benchmarks this morning and surprisingly, while the Razer Blade Advanced ran really hot there were no issues with the screen glitching and flickering... well that was until I opened up Notepad to pull my notes for these benchmarks! WTF. Anyway, here are the scores on what I was able to test.**Benchmarks*** FireStrike - 17916* TimeSpy - 8129* Cinebench Single Core: 1484* Cinebench Multicore: 8094* Tomb Raider: 14863 / 95 FPSRazer really needs to work on their quality control!",3

1757,Razer,"Unstable & overpriced. Second update: I got an infrared surface temperature gauge just to see what the usual operating temperature was for this laptop. They spaces between the keyboard keys, which are so hot they hurt to touch, are 128.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 53.6 degrees Celsius. The back of the laptop was the same temperature while it was running on a specially designed stand to help it vent heat. When I put it on my actual lap the back of the laptop reached146.4/63.6 degrees. The core temp is operating between 194-212/90-100.All this while 3 tabs in Google chrome were open on the laptop, and that was it.The outer corners are 122/50, for god's sake. 124 is hot enough to burn, so even using the attached keyboard has become impossible. Worst of all, the constant operation near the boiling point of water is going to cause thermal rotting and ultimately kill the laptop. ""Has heating issues"" and ""is so poorly designed that it will literally cook itself to death"" are two very different issues that I wish had been more clearly stated in the product reviews. I will never be buying from Razer again.Update:Just when I thought this molten hunk of garbage couldn't be any more useless, it's started crashing after 20 minutes of running photoshop. It's been 5 months and I already need a new laptop, because this one is literally incapable of outperforming a 2014 Toshiba satellite radius with an AMD graphics card. Burn your money, it'll be more worthwhile (and generate less heat).Old review:At the beginning of the year I was running a passable laptop from 2014 and was in dire need of an upgrade. I run some graphics-heavy programs but nothing all *that* taxing (it's literally just some advanced photoshop stuff).My 2014 laptop handled everything I need to do and more better than this Razer. If the screen hadn't been on the verge of death & I in need of an nvidia-brand card, I would have been better off replacing parts for that. This laptop overheated after 10 minutes of VLC media player running a 1080p TV episode. JUST THAT. Trying to actually use this laptop is a constant battle. I can't believe this is actually something anyone would use for gaming. Maybe emulating snes rpgs with turn-based battles, but I'm on the fence about whether it could even handle that without locking up.",1
1758,Razer,"Incredible productivity computer I got this computer to primarily edit and render photos and videos. For that purpose, this thing is an absolute beast. For gaming, I can't say that there is ANY laptop I would recommend, but this one definitely gets toasty. I disabled the turbo on the i7 in the bios to drop temps, and the palm rests/space over the keyboard get warm to the finger in about 30-60 minutes of MTG: Arena, which isn't exactly a rough title to render.However, again, this laptop is killer for productivity. Ten T5 Torx screws hold the bottom cover on, which simply levers off with light pressure. Both SSD slots are dual type, meaning that any spare drives you have around will be compatible with the empty spare slot, and RAM is easily accessible and upgradeable to 64gb. I've elected to keep mine at 16gb for now, I've never been much for multitasking.Build quality is excellent, and in my opinion is the killer feature of the Blade. The multitouch trackpad is fluid and responsive, resisting oil buildup and remaining very low friction. Gestures work first try. The chassis and screen feel sturdy, without noticeable flex. The hinge magnets are firm, but workable with both hands (1 hand tends to slide it around the desk surface rather than opening the thing). Yeah, it's a fingerprint magnet. I've got more than enough microfibers to not be bothered, though.Overall, if you're expecting to do some light gaming between productive tasks up to rendering video, the Blade will see you through, and it'll look good doing it. If you want to do AAA gaming binges, build a desktop. There's just not enough ventilation in laptops to do that kind of stressful load, and the thermals WILL shorten the life of your computer.",5
1759,Razer,"Long time Razer fan, truly disappointed. Ordered this new laptop to game / twitch stream, on the go when I'm away from my office. I purchased from Amazon as condition: NEW, there is no way this is a ""NEW"" laptop! I open it up to find a damaged power adapter, prongs bent and battery brick scratched, the top and bottom of the laptop look like its been handled by 20 people, grease and smudges everywhere! Then the stickers on the keyboard look like someone stuck them on after they have already been peeled off, the keys are worn, as well as what looks like water or fluid that has dried on the screen, GROSS! The laptop did manage to boot for now, running diagnostics on it to make sure it fine, but this is the 1ST TIME IN 10 YEARS of buying Razer products that I have ever had this kind of experience. I have bought several keyboards, headsets, mice, etc. from Razer in the past and have talked about them highly to friends and viewers, that now will STOP. Razer's tag line has always been ""For Gamers, By Gamers"" ...no gamer would ever let this machine go out the door looking like this. Truly Disappointing.",1

1762,Razer,"Too Thin I bought this on impulse on a prime day discount.I rather wish that I'd thought a little harder about it.This is definitely a quality product.After four months with the laptop I haven't noticed any particular signs of undue wear or anything to indicated that corners were cut in terms of manufacturing.The hardware can handle pretty much anything I throw at it, including moderate gaming and use for 3d modeling software.My last laptop I endedup purchasing 3 aftermarket power bricks for my last laptop before the power socket mechanically failed, so I especially like the quality of the brick they included with the Razer and it's solid attachment point.The touch pad isn't my favorite, it's so big that I tend to get a lot of unintended contact, but I've used far worse.It's also free from the loads of bloatware that comes preinstalled on many systems.Where I have to lop off a couple points is the heat management.This thing gets HOT.This is probably my fault, but from the webpage here I got the impression that this laptop was a lot thicker than it really is.The lacking of proper space inside for airflow and heat management really shows.If you actually put this on your lap you may well burn your leg under heavy load since the only fans point straight down.You'll need to account for that if you place it on a desktop.It's got a tiny spacer pad on the bottom, but you're going to need to do something to make sure that it can get some air moving under there.Also keep in mind that it's going to run down or out the battery running the fans after you're done with it.Essentially the problem is not with the quality of the build, just trying to shove too much powerful hardware in too tiny a package for the sake of looks.I'd have much rather taken function over form.Still, if you're willing to try to solve the heat management issues on your own with a cooling pad or something it's a good collection of hardware for the price in an otherwise solid package.",3

1767,Razer,Light but buggy Have been using it for the past 8 months and although useful has been extremely buggy. Keyboard switches off occasionally and have to turn off laptop to reboot. Have had screen issues when using Youtube or chrome. Battery life isn't quite as advertised but is definitely light and pretty quiet.,2
1768,Razer,Hurts to use. Sharp edges. Hurts to use. No physical touchpad buttons.,3
1769,Razer,Touch screen? When I bought this I thought it had a touch screen. But it doesnt.It also doenst have a way for me to talk during my zoom classes. Which is the main reason I bought it. So yeah that is annoying. Overall its a great computer.,5
1770,Razer,"Best portable for moderate gamers Original review was for 5 stars until several months later my screen got a substantial flicker.It took a week for support to help and hours of my own time to fix it with literally dozens of ""things to try"" rather than addressing the specific issue.For an expensive laptop, Razer Synapse software should be able to do the job as designed (and support team) should be able to update everything correctly.This is my last Razer laptop!Buyer beware.",2
1771,Razer,"Don't do it Don't waste ur money.For the price, it's not worth it. A 1650ti MaxQ for $1800? Don't do it.

1773,Razer,Solid laptop This is SO much better than the MSI laptop I had before it.,5
1774,Razer,This thing is amazing I love the screen resolution. The gpu works great I got the basic but its easily expandable. Ordered and extra m.2 to add extra storage. And ik its over kill but I also ordered 2 x16 gb ram sticks giving me 32 gb. The 3060 inside runs almost all graphics at max settings np. Only draw backs. The thing gets HOT if you don't go into razor cortex and make sure the fans are on full blast while gaming. Or doing heavy multi tasking. I also had to orderset of kick stands I put on the bottom to give it extra air flow and not only do I love the better angle it help it greatly. Second the keyboard is definitely a laptop keyboard with very little travel. Compared to other gaming laptops that have larger travel with the same thickness sub par. That being said I picked up a nice 60% keyboard (a 65% keyboard would work better)sit it on top of my track pad and it works perfectly. All of that being said im very happy with my purchase and would definitely buy it again,5

Its battery life as contrasted from other gaming laptops however is pretty decent. It games really fast and is so powerful that I can even smooth record gameplay without a capture card for YouTube. The one thing that stood out to me is that it does not get overly hot from what you would expect - It doesn’t give that “burning thighs” feeling after using it. For the money, it’s definitely worth $1800 including tax - lasts awhile and is more powerful than my $1200 desktop PC I’ve had for two years and I can carry it wherever. Very convenient and worth the price! Best purchase I’ve made in a long time.",5
1782,Razer,could be better I got a the top base model. It does everything I need it to but the battery life on it could be better. If im just doing class work the battery will last about 5-6 hr. anything more intensive and it quickly kills it. But if you have it plugged in its not a big deal. Very quick and graphics are great especially for a laptop. I did have to contact support to fix the battery drain issue when i first got it as it wouldnt last more than 2 1/2 hours off the charger. ended up having to do a system recovery and reinstall all updates and drivers. Still a good laptop just dont wonder to far away from an outlet,3

1789,Razer,"dead pixels I used this pc for work and light gaming, very minimally really. After a few months I noticed some red defective pixels on the left side of the screen.Long story short, after going through the troubleshooting process that Razer customer service walked me through, they had me wipe the PC and send it to them for repair. I received it back in a timely fashion, re-installed my files, and got back to work.Now, just 2 weeks later, I have noticed more defective pixels on the right side of the screen. I am loathe to go through the return process again, and wish to return the unit for a refund, as I've had more problems with this ""high end"" machine than any other laptop I've owned.I'll update this review as the situation unfolds.",1
1790,Razer,"Pretty good so far... Took a gamble and bought ""Used - Very Good"" and the condition was basically perfect.Been using for 4 months and so far only had a few ""issues"" that were resolved (by me).1. Heard electric whine coming from laptop. Was concerned at first but noticed my other laptops also do it... seems normal for laptops.2. Games were suddenly very sluggish with huge fps drops. I just had to update the GPU drivers and it was fixed. (I didnt think to do this right away). Mainly play csgo and easily run at 300fps. Sometimes play apex and have no issues except it cant run apex at 150fps+.3. Speaking of Apex... the laptop gets VERY hot for intense games. I plug external monitor+mouse+keyboard so its not a big issue but it WILL heat up your room. The room temperature increase is noticeable. I dont think it's feasible to play on the laptop keyboard when playing something like Apex since the laptop gets too hot. My palms get sweaty and overall not a pleasant experience. The vapor cooling seems to work pretty well though... even when gaming for 10hours+ at high temps I dont get performance drops which is amazing imo. I considered getting a fan that sits under the laptop but it doesnt seem necessary. We'll see how it holds up over time.4. One day, bluetooth stopped working entirely. It just disappeared... even from Device Manager. I googled the issue and a BIOS reset fixed it.PROS:Build quality feels great. Impressed by it. Almost at mbp level.Great performance. I've played csgo, apex, gtav, mordhau, and valorant all with no issues.Screen looks pretty good. Not mbp level but better than average laptop screen imo. I'd imagine the 4k 60hz looks even better. (higher refresh rates monitors almost always look worse than lower rate picture-focused monitors)Does not come with a bunch of bloatware. (i hate bloatware w a passion)CONS:The laptop keyboard is HORRIBLE. Travel distance is so low it's annoying to use.You must install their proprietary razer software to customize the keyboard lighting.Gets VERY hot.Brand doesnt seem to have a good reputation for longevity so I do worry that it will randomly die on me one day.Logo on the lid is very ugly in my opinion.Wish it had one more usb c port.Overall, it's an extremely difficult task to compete with Apple and I'm happy that Razer put effort into creating a high end product that feels fairly polished. Four months in and I'm pleased with my purchase.Some misc thoughts... I dont think it was necessary for the screen to go up to 300hz... 240 is good enough imo... Would be nice if, for future versions, they got rid of the huge charger and made it usb c charge. Would be nice if I could buy a version with no webcam and they got rid of the top bezel.",4
1791,Razer,"Happy with purchase Very capable laptop with great built quality; fan was barely running with typical use and does its job when demand rises up. I didn't buy a brand new one but a, in Amazon's words, ""used one"". However, I can't find on the laptop itself any signs of being used before, and it worked just fine.",5
1792,Razer,"Constant issues and Amazon Garbage Packaging I bought 2 of these for myself and my partner so we could play some games together. one was New and the other was Used - Very Good.The ""Very Good"" laptop was shipped in a box 20 times it's size with almost no packaging material what so ever, it was twisted and bent so it didn't sit flush with a flat surface anymore and wobbled like a table with a short leg. It was also covered in glue and stains, there was also no charger included.The second laptop, the ""New"" one came packaged fine in it's razer box, but the screen constantly goes black with static.It does it at random times like in games or just browsing the web.Definitely don't plan on buying another Razer, and never testing my luck with a used laptop from Amazon again.",1
1793,Razer,"Poor quality/design - bad support As a gaming laptop, this system is one of the best i have ever used. It runs smoothly, and beautifully.However, after owning this laptop for about 6 months, it is entirely unusable. In the course of connecting the charger, the pin has become bent. If it is even slightly off alignment, the material is so weak and flimsy it will bend becoming unusable, rather than snapping/guiding into place or providing any resistance/feedback that maybe its not lined up right. For a part that is meant to be connected and disconnected potentially multiple times a day, on a laptop that costs over $2,000, this should hold up to a little use.After going back and forth with Razer support for weeks, they have decided that this is ""inappropriate use"" or ""customer neglect"" on my part and refuse to cover it under warranty. Even going so far as to say that it would be ""unfair to those who bought RazerCare"" to cover it under warranty.There is literally no reason it needs to be this fancy 3 pin design with the smaller pins being so flimsy. Look at other laptops, and you see simple round ports, or Apple Magsafe ports. dont try to reinvent the wheel, and then fail, and then blame your customer for not using it right.Avoid this laptop and Razer support.",1

I took it with me on a vacation, after I took it out of the suitcase it had a lot of problems with going to sleep. I turn it on press a character it goes to sleep. I wake it back up I start typing again it goes back to sleep. I leave it alone for an hour come back I can use it for 2 minutes and then it goes back to sleep. I wake it up and I can use it for about 3 seconds and it goes back to sleep. It felt like a temperature issue so I downloaded some temperature monitoring software and no temperature problem it just wants to go back to sleep. I run Windows update but the problem still persists. This is a good laptop as long as you don't ever put your laptop in a suitcase.Update: this seems to have gone away later idk what was going on then. Make sure you have a backup device if you take this with you traveling.",4

Even though the laptop is only 8 months old, Razer does not accept the warranty through the reseller, and I cannot return the item via Amazon. Avoid Razer laptops, their support is not robust like other manufactures. The laptop is solidly built, I like the metal chassis and top-notch performance, as well as the sleek lines and customizable chromas. Its very disappointing the laptop's lack of support means I am stuck with a defective product. If the webcam worked, and/or I could get support for it without additional cost, this would be 5/5 stars.",1
1799,Razer,I would not recommend I’ve had a razor laptop now for about 2 years and it’s just simply underperformed. The battery is complete trash and won’t last now over maybe 30 minutes without needing charged. I’m not doing anything crazy with this computer at all and it’s output seriously diminished in the last year or so. I’m trying to find a good example that people can relate to. I trade cryptocurrency and I literally cannot get up to date info without it lagging like crazy and just being weird. I have the laptop at 100% performance and don’t have any other tabs open. That’s not acceptable at all. I would never recommend this companies laptop to anyone. It underperforms over time and the battery is non existent after 6 months.,2
1800,Razer,Good Laptop! It’s a really good and strong laptop use it everyday for work and games however it does get very hot.,4
1801,Razer,"Runs well, but very hot! Power/battery issues I've had the laptop for a while now (almost a year). The performance is good, I haven't had any issue with the games I play and, while small, the picture on the screen is nice.That being said there are some glaring issues.- The fit and finish seems nice at first but you still get that typical smudging on the matt finish. So you're either constantly cleaning or it always looks dirty.- the fans spool up constantly and the laptop is unbearably hot. Don't ever plan to have this laptop on your lap. Mine lives on an additional cooling tray. As I'm afraid of components melting.- Power supply: the braided cable seems nice at first, but within a month it just becomes tattered and frayed it just looks ugly and doesn't seem to serve a real purpose if the strands of the weave aren't strong enough to be slid across the floor once in a while. Less than a year in and the power supply has stopped working. Green light comes on when plugged in and dies within second. The frustrating part is with a unique power adapter you can't salvage from another computer.One note: you cannot change the outline color of individual keys on this laptop. Doesn't make a different to me but just a note.Overall I would not recommend this laptop. If you're looking at this laptop, just buy a desktop.",2
1802,Razer,"Great gaming laptop with excellent build quality I have been OBSESSED with this laptop since I got it. I love to game so I had been needing to get a proper gaming laptop. This thing is a BEAST. It has a beautiful 144hz display and a graphics card that is very capable for the games that I play. I gave battery life 4 stars because it could be a bit better, but anyone who games should 100% be using this laptop plugged in to experience the full power. And this laptop has EXCELLENT build quality; It’s on the expensive side but the build makes up for it. This laptop can give me framerates of up to 144 fps on high to ultra settings in some games. Overall, I completely recommend this laptop for a person that plays triple a titles or someone like me that plays a mixture of graphics intensive and light games.",5

1807,Razer,"it very nice on the surface but has some serious issues The laptop throws up BSODs after about 20m of any use or a few minutes after a fullscreen youtube video. The error log says its a display driver issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the intel graphics driver. I have tried turning off and on hardware acceleration in chrome and firefox. It still crashes constantly. At least it reboots fast.You can replace the NVME but it needs to be 1tb or less because if the ram modules are on both sides it wont fit.If I run a synthetic CPU stress test like aida64 it crashes immediately. Updating the bios and rolling back the intel graphics driver does not fix this. The cooling solution works fine, its not overheating",1
1808,Razer,"Fantastic! Buuuuuut..... Great laptop for work. Portable light and awesome battery life. BUT! Maybe it's bc of the Intel Iris on board graphics, the laptop doesn't seem to cooperate well with Razer's external gpu enclosure. Both the chroma and the non chroma version gpu enclosures will give you the dreaded BSOD at least twice during the day. Even tried messing around with the nvidia drivers for my 2060 gpu and intels iris drivers. At least it forces me to get more work done at the office rather than playing a game here and there.",4

1810,Razer,"Ultra portable and ultra powerful! My wife needed a new laptop and this fit the bill and performs beyond my expectations. The build quality is excellent with the keyboard feeling great and the all-aluminum case being rigid and sturdy. The screen resolution is fantastic and the picture is crisp and the colors are vibrant. The unit is very lightweight but also very ""dense"". What I mean by that is the build quality feels very sturdy while being carried or moving it around. If I had only one complaint it's that the built-in 256 GB SSD is a little small, but it looks like upgrading the drive isn't terribly difficult. In the month or so that my wife has been using the laptop almost daily she's had no issues whatsoever. The Razer software that comes pre-installed on the machine that handles driver updates and such is a little obnoxious as it seems to update and run at odd times, sometimes while in the middle of doing things. This isn't really a deal breaker or anything, it's just something to make note of.",5

1813,Razer,"Great laptop, lacks support After using the laptop (i7 FHD) for a couple of months I can definitely say it’s great: great specs and performance, great I/O, great build quality.EDIT: The ribbon cable that connects the monitor to the motherboard was severely deformed under normal use. Opening and closing the monitor multiple times revealed the manufacturing/assembly issue. This does not inflict any real problems to the machine (other than cosmetic) *yet*. Razer fails to support my case because my country is not under their ""shipping network"", so I can't have it be RMA'd for further inspections. So much for int'l shipping and warranty :(It’s lightweight and generally quiet (fans are usually off and ramp up only when needed), and the trackpad is awesome. I like the Gamer-y RGB keyboard just for that custom look.Though not a gaming machine by any means, Intel Iris Xe performs well for simple games and can even edit some FHD content (though not 4K). No complaints about the 11th Gen i7 processor either.Battery life is great, can work whole day without really needing to plug in, even when using many programs and VMs simultaneously. I personally don’t really use the touch screen, but it’s nice to have.However there are some (seemingly common) issues with this device: the keyboard misses some stokes (especially when pressing at the edge of the key), I had frequent BSOD (Windows blue screens) and sudden reboots which were supposedly caused by the new Intel Iris Xe Graphics, and were fixed by updating drivers via Intel Driver & Support Assistant — rather than by driver updates from Razer. Even though the BSOD occur due to Intel-Windows compatibility, Razer lacks giving proper support for their customers — especially through driver updates. If I hadn’t had the know-how, I would have to ship it back.EDIT: although frequency of BSODs dropped, the issue still remains -- I've had many BSODs since writing this review.For the general population, I would encourage not purchasing the 8GB RAM version since it’s not upgradable and it’s just too little for the several years to come. If the price for the 16GB is too high, look for some other less expensive laptops.All in all, especially after fixing the BSODs, I would definitely recommend this laptop for productivity power users such as myself. Though, I would be happier to see 512 GB storage at this price point and a 32 GB RAM version for those who need it.EDIT: Although seemingly perfect for my needs, I was wrong in buying this product. Lack of support in drivers and RMA on Razer's side cause me huge trouble and inconvenience.",2
1814,Razer,"Great perf and build quailty, but runs too hot and display too reflective The build quality is great. I use it as daily driver and as workstation replacement. It is probably the best workstation replacement that money can buy (macos devices are great for browsing facebook, but if you need to get a work done, you need this).The touch screen is pointless - just make it regular screen. I guess it can be thinner/lighter/cheaper if so. Nobody needs the touchscreen.Also - the display is really bright, but also more reflective than bright. Really hard to use in outdoors. Either make it less reflective (preferred) or make it mat (second best).Sound is okay, but not okay for that price range.Keyboard is good, touchpad is good.Quadro is *amazing*. The Intel 8c/16t CPU is great as well for perf, but .. runs too hot. I would still prefer Intel CPU + thunderbolt than AMD + non thunderbolt though. Probably worth thinking though to add hot air exhausts from the side as well.Overall - great buy if you need workstation replacement. Much better than the Macbook, as you can get work done. Has RTX with 16GB. Good CPU.Next version - please work on screen (no touchscreen needed, too reflective) - thats the most major thing that needs improving (colors, brightness are great, just reflectivity is awful), thermals (just adding ""cool"" mode where perf is down, but the whole thing runs colder might do it - the Razer Synapse seems to have something like this, but it is not aggresive enough).",3

When I tried contacting support it took an hour just to get a live agent and the agent was completely useless.

The Amazon posting seems confusing, and for the cost, I did not want to receive a sub-par computer.

1820,Razer,"The Savior Laptop I Needed! I had just purchased an HP Envy laptop before this and unfortunately that laptop failed on me within 2 weeks and had to be returned. I was frantically looking for a laptop that was built or could be customized with the specifications I needed for photo and 4K video editing.I spent an entire day looking for a laptop that would arrive in the time that I needed. Fortunately I came across this one and was recommended this by someone. I had heard of Razer, but many gaming notebooks are too big and bulky for me, or don't have 4K displays. To my surprise I saw this Studio Edition that was PERFECT!I've now owned this for 2 months and it works like a clock! I would have never purchased this if my new HP hadn't died. My HP was about $2600, whereas when I purchased this it was $4000. That's quite a bit more than what I wanted to spend for a machine, but the specs were what I needed and then some and I simply wanted a machine that worked.Because of the great experience I've had with this so far I'm now switched from HP after 10 years to making Razer my laptop choice going forward. My 2 remaining HP's will be retired and replaced with a Razer laptop when the time comes.The most amazing thing of this laptop is how thin it is (and LIGHT), but offers such a powerful GPU like the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000. This GPU can handle anything! I've edited without issue in Adobe Premiere Pro and have played intense games, such as Need for Speed Heat and this computer goes without any hesitation. The audio is amazing, the 4K OLED touch display is beautiful (and the accuracy of the calibration by Razer is awesome, much better than what my HP Envy was).Out the box my HP Envy had 64GB of RAM, where this is only 32GB, but you can upgrade this to 64GB, which is a huge plus! It's a laptop you're sure to have for for at least 6 or so years, if not more.I also loved that this laptop had an abundance of ports! This was also a big requirement. There's really nothing to dislike about this laptop. As my first gaming laptop, I will say the color keyboard is so nice! Gaming laptops really are something special and as my first one I certainly will say you can't go wrong if you're a gamer or content creator like I am.",5
1821,Razer,"Drool worthy After pouring over dozens of online reviews, I gave in to this spendy laptop.Does. Not. Disappoint.It's dusted in crack or something, though, so be careful not to get too addicted to using it. I did, and I'm not even ashamed.",5
1822,Razer,"Excellent Workhorse. Maybe, too powerful I bought this to do some 3D modeling and streaming. It runs beautifully for those tasks. I'm able to sculpt in full textures in Blender in real time with no lag while streaming my work. Holy cow, it's powerful. That said, the fan is definitely struggling to keep up with this, and don't think about using it without a power source nearby. It blows through power. Maybe to the point where it needs an upgraded adapter.As a sturdy work machine, it's great if you have a station set up. Screen has great resolution, and colors are very true-to-life. I love this little beast, and I'm hoping it lasts for the next five years or so. There were some fan issues at one point, but popping out the battery and resetting it did the trick. I would definitely suggest a usb fan-cooled lap desk if you're going to actually use it as a laptop.For a gaming rig, it's obviously got some heft to it, but if you're not streaming and really putting it through the motions with mods, I really wouldn't stretch your budget for this. It's nice, but gaming is under-utilizing it, if anything. Also, why do they keep insisting touchscreen is such a premium? I could do without gumming up the excellent visuals with my fingerprints.Pros:-Nice design, very work professional with brushed aluminum-Surprisingly lightweight-GeForce RTX-Great resolution-PowerfulCons:-Too powerful?-Low battery life-Meant to be a working professional's book-touchscreen (personal distaste)",5
1823,Razer,"Crap quality, with Apple pricing. It's the laptop equivalent of painting a turd gold. The build quality of a chassis is 9/10, that's the only good thing I have to say about this laptop. Unless you can burn 3 grand every year and not lose any sleep you're taking a huge gamble on purchasing this laptop. I'm begging you to look at just about any other option.",1
1824,Razer,"Amazing performance, gets very hot I've had this for a month or so, this thing kicks ass, it hasn't let me down yet and the graphics for modern games like black ops cold war and cyberpunk are amazing, ray tracing and everything. In intense firefights things can sometimes lag but I always get 60fps. The only issue is the heat. This thing gets HOT!!! So definitely get a high quality laptop cooler, they seem to do a good job. But ultimately, when playing graphic intensive games, you should stop playing every 2 or so hours to let it cool down. also it is a fingerprint and dust magnet so keep it clean. I also invested in a 2tb ssd for the extra slot and with all that space you can have tons of games movies music and apps, could always replace the first ssd too. Tons of ports, nice but not so useful touch screen. A big complaint is the the performance on battery, I can't find an option to increase performance on battery so it needs to be plugged in to the huge power brick to run games on high, but skyrim minecraft and other older games run fine on battery. The speakers are acceptable but if you want a good experience buy gaming headphones",5
1825,Razer,"Powerful, Runs Dangerously Hot This is a review of the touchscreen high end version of this laptop, as shown by the link of the purchase above, and not the lesser versions.Overall pretty good machine. Overpriced for the graphics card included (3k+ when I purchased it), but has dropped in price since I purchased. Runs very hot (definitely fire hazard for power brick if not careful) and a bit noisy for sensitive ears when gaming.Pros:Powerful. Ran everything I threw at it with Ultra/maximum settings and no issues. Everything looked and played well. RTX is great on things that support it.Samsung Odyssey HMD+ WMR experience worked great.Output to big screen TV worked great.Touch screen is awesome.Beautiful, high resolution screen.Very thin laptop.Battery life is decent for a high end system. (Will drain faster if playing games with maxed settings while on battery, of course.)Cons:Runs extremely hot. Laptop gets darn hot during gaming. The power brick becomes a fire hazard and will burn flesh after running anything intensive for a small period of time. (So beware!)Fingerprint magnet. Taking it out of the box will immediately have case looking horrible.Dust magnet. The touchpad is not flush with the laptop case, so dust immediately fills in the edge surrounding the touchpad. The speakers on case either side of keyboard also collect dust. Makes touchpad and speakers look dirty quickly, and difficult to clean without brush or mini-vac.Fan gets a bit loud during high-end gaming. But I’ve had other high-end gaming laptops that were worse. I usually connect an external usb fan lap table, so the extra noise not as bothersome for me and this helped making hot laptop bearable. But this is definitely more tabletop than laptop if you’re gaming.Screen doesn’t fold all the way around for a proper tablet mode, but knew that going in. It would be nice if it did, though.Final thoughts; performance and functionality is great, but the physical issues reduced the overall experience. Would have given 5-stars if not for case and heat issues.",3
1826,Razer,"Great alternative for Desktop PC This laptop is great for create video, gaming, mining. I like it. But it’s so sensitive for fingerprints.",5
1827,Razer,3080 Amazing laptop,5
1828,Razer,"Laptop display died 20 days after delivery Very disappointing. Laptop display died 20 days after delivery. I purchased from Japan, so return is being a nightmare. Amazon covers only USD15.00 for a cost of USD160 shipment. First and last time I buy something from Razer.",1
1829,Razer,"All the latest Tech - great performance - But runs hot It's important to know what you're buying when you purchase this. It's a very thin laptop packed with all the latest hardware and display tech, at least the model I purchased. There are thicker 17 inch plus beasts out there, made out of plastic with better thermal performance. It performs extremely well for gaming given its compactness, it handles my office and video and photo editing with ease. It DOES run hot under full load, and a laptop cooling pad with fans is ideally necessary as the base can get quite hot especially against the skin. But I bought this for it's aluminum shell and portability, packed with all the latest technology. It does what I need it to do well, but, understand this comes at the cost of thermal performance without external cooling. The display is perfect in color and response, the 3080 accomplishes any task I can throw at it even at only 85w. The chroma lighting is beautiful and the keyboard performs well and is pleasant to use for office tasks. The audio with THX is quite good given its size.",5
1830,Razer,So Powerful This is a very powerful machine with the RTX 3080 and OLED display.,5
1831,Razer,Great looking and Good performing Laptop The laptop performs great and can handle practically anything you throw at it. It is important to note that performance out of the box is heavily throttled as the CPU is limited to 2.3GHz. Through Razer Synapse both the GPU and CPU speeds can be increased to provide better performance. The fans can get loud but they do a great job keeping the keyboard/trackpad area cool and the only area that gets super hot is above the keyboard. Performance in games like Escape from Tarkov at (1440p Max settings) is good with the framerate fluctuating between 60-120fps depending on the map and population. My biggest gripe is that there is no Ethernet port.There was an issue out of the box where it was attempting to use the Integrated graphics instead of the GPU which limited the refresh rate of the screen but this was fixed by disabling the IGPU in the BIOS,5
1832,Razer,"It’s loud, really loud. This laptop is extremely loud high pitch whistling sounds. It will give most headaches even bothers pets. People comment even over the phone about the sound it makes. Still runs uncomfortably hot. No drivers on Razer Support so forget about changing the SSD. No mouse drivers seem to work after reinstall. Cheap RAM and stock NVME drive no longer Samsung like years before. Chinese branded. Speakers are still terrible sounding even with THX “enhancement” software. Keyboard mushy and shallow. Performance isn’t that great either nothing special here. Get a warranty if you must buy I have a feeling it will be needed down the line. I’ll most likely be returning the system I got. To many compromises for high price. I’ve had 2018 and 2019 models and they all seem about the same returned all of them. I really wanted to like this laptop.",2
1833,Razer,"Good but could be better Bought used a few months ago. Very sleek and thin. You can feel the quality of the machined aluminum when holding it in your hands and how sturdy it is. The screen lid doesn't flex and stays put.As you can see in the pictures, the 4k gaming graphics are truly amazing. Notice the reflection of the trees on the car hood in Forza 4. See how the fire burns in Hitman 3. The RTX 2080 Super Max-Q graphics card does its job with ease.I only give it 3 stars due to the following:1. Its advertised as G-Sync capable, but the screen itself isn't G-Sync. You can tell the difference between playing Forza 4 on this Razer and the Razer Blade 17 Pro 2017 model. The 2017 model had G-Sync built in which made gameplay a bit smoother. This model has noticeable motion blur when playing high-end games.2. The 4k version of the Razer Blade Pro 17 2020 model is more of a content creation laptop than a gaming one. Better for heavy video editing and graphics design. It only has a 120hz refresh rate, less than the 300hz you get on the non-4k model. For serious gamers, this lower refresh rate hinders the quality screenplay on demanding games. Also, the Max-Q variant of the RTX 2080 Super lowers the power output by a lot. To keep the battery running and to lower fan noise, the Max-Q kicks in during heavy gaming and throttles the gpu to 11000 mhz, even less than a rtx 2070. The GTX 1080 on the 2017 model is also a tad more powerful. You will notice some slight staggering for newer games like Hitman 3 and Cyperpunk at 4k settings.3. Very sharp edges - ouch! Buy a laptop wrist pad for this one. You will get marks on your wrists and upper arms when using for a long time.4. Gets very hot during heavy gameplay.5. Very heavy. 7 pounds is a lot to carry around so keep this one at home.6. Tiny keys. I gripe about the keyboard each time I use it. The click feedback is great but need more travel. The keys are very tiny so expect missed keystrokes here and there.7. The 1 megapixel selfie web camera sucks. Very grainy. Not good for video conferencing.6. Overpiced - a nice machine that will last many years but I don't believe this should be sold for $3400-$3700 brand new. More like $2000 is appropriate.I enjoyed using it for the short time I owned it but I'm saving for a newer model.",3
1834,Razer,"Customer Service is Clueless. I had problems from the jump when I was unable to access the ""@"" key. CS claimed they had NO IDEA WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND WANTED TO RESET MACHINE TO FACTORY STANDARDS WIPING OUT THE SOFTWARE I SPENT 12 HOURS INSTALLING. Turns out if you have ""British Keyboard"" ( default) you have to hit shift and the "" key to get @ OF COURSE. THE FACT THAT CS DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS SCARY. THE FACT THE SUPERVISOR KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT WAS SCARIER.. Considering the high price point this cluelessness is unacceptable.",3
1835,Razer,"This laptop is outstanding and from Best Buys I have gone through so many different laptops trying to find the perfect one and previously I owned the MSI GS66 with an Intel Core i9 and Nvidia RTX 2080 super though I was not impressed with the screen quality and felt like I needed something a little bit more premium so I brought it back the Best Buys and I bought the 2020 Razer Blade Professional 17 And all I can say is I LOVE THIS LAPTOP!!The Razer Blade 17 has a large 17.3"" inch screen and a super clear 4k display and it gives the ultimate gamer experience. You can change the graphical settings for game performance including the brightness/contrast and change the panel resolution and the screen aspect ratio all from the Nvidia control pane.So don't worry there's really no limitations for this laptop. I definitely recommend this laptop or its 2021 variant.",5
1836,Razer,"It's great I have a couple minor complains, like the short battery life, that you can't change the color of the led on the back or that if I bought it again I think the touchscreen is not worth it. It's still great tho. There's not that many gaming pcs that have a sleek design. I'm really happy with my purchase. The big screen is wonderfull",5
1837,Razer,"Fantastic build quality and high end components. Terrible keyboard and touchpad. The closest thing I have found to the excellent build quality of a MacBook Pro. Very solid an inflexible unibody construction and very high end components.However, it is clear that Razor has an engineering staff of nine geniuses and one idiot. In an incredibly boneheaded and unjustifiable move, they have reversed the labeling on the keys. For some asinine reason that serves no purpose other than to make your life miserable, they decided to place the symbols BELOW the numbers instead of above. And all the keys with dual characters (like colon and semicolon) are also backwards from every other keyboard on the planet. Insanity.Everybody's brain is wired to shift UP to the symbols. Not shift DOWN to them. So typing passwords with symbols is now a serious pain. Looking for the period or equal sign or semicolon? I promise you that your eyes will go right to the bottom of the key, and then won't find it. No human being, touch typist or not, recalls whether to shift for the square or curly bracket. You will look, you will see the backwards layout, and then you will type the wrong one. Again, completely idiotic move without the slightest benefit. I still may end up returning it before the return window expires.The only other serious complaint is over the touchpad. I fight it all day long. It alternately ignores very definite taps, and then responds to the slightest of all touches from the heel of my hand. This causes the cursor to randomly jump elsewhere on the screen or, as has happened TWICE while writing this, selecting all text in the text field so that your next keystroke overwrites all of it. My MacBook Pro touchpad was always flawless. No amount of adjustment in the Windows settings ends these problems.All said, an stupidity aside, the components and build quality are excellent. This truly is a desktop replacement when it comes to power and graphics performance. Just wish they would fire that one engineer.",3
1838,Razer,"Above mediocre, but maddening keyboard. It's apparently impossible to get a high-end gaming laptop with a decent keyboard. On this particular machine, the arrow keys are maddening. It's not just the position of the Up and Down keys, but the fact that they register only about 1/3 of the presses. Scrolling through a dropdown listbox with the keyboard is nearly impossible, often requiring pressing so hard that it thinks both keys are being pressed.Until this is rectified, this will be my last Razer regardless of its other specs.",3

Their forums are littered with hundreds of complaints and there's been literally no reply as to what the issue might be. But in the meantime, they've released new energy drinks and new plush toys. I guess that indicates their values.Do NOT spend your money on their laptops. Buy something else from another brand.

What I mean by that is the build quality feels very sturdy while being carried or moving it around. If I had only one complaint it's that the built-in 256 GB SSD is a little small, but it looks like upgrading the drive isn't terribly difficult. In the month or so that my wife has been using the laptop almost daily she's had no issues whatsoever. The Razer software that comes pre-installed on the machine that handles driver updates and such is a little obnoxious as it seems to update and run at odd times, sometimes while in the middle of doing things.

1862,Razer,"Great laptop, lacks support After using the laptop (i7 FHD) for a couple of months I can definitely say it’s great: great specs and performance, great I/O, great build quality.EDIT: The ribbon cable that connects the monitor to the motherboard was severely deformed under normal use. Opening and closing the monitor multiple times revealed the manufacturing/assembly issue. This does not inflict any real problems to the machine (other than cosmetic) *yet*. Razer fails to support my case because my country is not under their ""shipping network"", so I can't have it be RMA'd for further inspections. So much for int'l shipping and warranty :(It’s lightweight and generally quiet (fans are usually off and ramp up only when needed), and the trackpad is awesome. I like the Gamer-y RGB keyboard just for that custom look.Though not a gaming machine by any means, Intel Iris Xe performs well for simple games and can even edit some FHD content (though not 4K). No complaints about the 11th Gen i7 processor either.Battery life is great, can work whole day without really needing to plug in, even when using many programs and VMs simultaneously. I personally don’t really use the touch screen, but it’s nice to have.However there are some (seemingly common) issues with this device: the keyboard misses some stokes (especially when pressing at the edge of the key), I had frequent BSOD (Windows blue screens) and sudden reboots which were supposedly caused by the new Intel Iris Xe Graphics, and were fixed by updating drivers via Intel Driver & Support Assistant — rather than by driver updates from Razer. Even though the BSOD occur due to Intel-Windows compatibility, Razer lacks giving proper support for their customers — especially through driver updates. If I hadn’t had the know-how, I would have to ship it back.EDIT: although frequency of BSODs dropped, the issue still remains -- I've had many BSODs since writing this review.For the general population, I would encourage not purchasing the 8GB RAM version since it’s not upgradable and it’s just too little for the several years to come. If the price for the 16GB is too high, look for some other less expensive laptops.All in all, especially after fixing the BSODs, I would definitely recommend this laptop for productivity power users such as myself. Though, I would be happier to see 512 GB storage at this price point and a 32 GB RAM version for those who need it.EDIT: Although seemingly perfect for my needs, I was wrong in buying this product. Lack of support in drivers and RMA on Razer's side cause me huge trouble and inconvenience.",2

I do alot of work on After Effects and will see how she performs. Overall happy with the Razer 15 :) I'm a bit bummed that the base version does not have 'windows hello', but not really a big deal, what makes up for it is that the base model has an ethernet port plus space for a 2.5"" hard drive, really helps alot as footage from cameras/drone can tale up alot of space. Packaging was horrible, the box it came in was severely dented, with no bubble wrap or anything inside to protect the Razer from any bumps..

While a 144 hz monitor would have been ideal, the 60 hz fit my budget better and still looks great for a gaming laptop. I mainly play FPS games at lower settings for higher framerates so I can't comment on just how hard you can push graphics but I personally have no complaints on performance.The two complaints I do have are purely aesthetic. I wish the Razer logo weren't a green outline with backlighting. It would look much better if the logo had a black outline that you could backlight to keep a cleaner look in a professional setting. Case covers from Razer would be nice as I tried a MacBook cover but it wouldn't fit.My second complaint is the keyboard layout. They made it feel sort of cramped by putting speakers on the sides when I believe there's enough room to put the speaker above the keyboard so you can widen the actual key layout.But, these two minor issues are absolutely minimal. As far as gaming laptops go, this is the best looking and thinnest gaming laptop I've experienced that still delivers great performance with a solid display.If you're in the market for a multipurpose laptop, this is a great choice.",5

Just because something is made out of aluminum, doesn't make it an Apple quality computer.Keyboard and trackpad ARE NOT as nice as Apple (I am talking about classic apple keyboards), nor as nice as my Surface Book 3.Keyboard is shallow without any spring to it. and trackpad is a pain in the a** to click. Takes too much pressure.Windows Hello camera is awful. I am not sure why no one talks about that. Surface Book 3 camera instantly recognizes my facefrom any angle. I am lucky to get 4 positive Windows Hello logins out of 10 attempts on a Razer. Its better to just type your password.Same goes for its web camera. 3200 dollar laptop with a 720P camera. Crappy one too. lol How much is a camera for a laptop? 1 dollar for 720p and 2 bucks for 1080??Speakers are just OK. Not great, or fine by any stretch of the imagination. They'll get the job done, but lets not praise them.I DO NOT trust Razer when it comes to quality. This laptops has been fantastic so far. No crashes, no issues, but every piece of equipment I purchased from Razer developed problems within 3 years. Every keyboard, every mouse. I had a Blade 14 before that, and it was working great for exactly 2.5 years.After 2 years I ended up with a swollen battery, and laptop would randomly go to sleep, or NOT go to sleep regardless of any BIOS/ Windows settings. Full reinstalls, etc. This laptop gets very hot, and its just a matter of time until the battery gives out. Since the battery is user replaceable, its not a big deal.Good things:It is fast! Has a fantastic SSD drive, great OLED screen and surprisingly enough... NOT A BAD battery life. If you set it to power save mode, and lower the brightness of OLED to 35% (its a very bright screen),I can get up to 6 hours out of it.2080 is a very nice card, and I have it running HL:Alyx as well as Elite Dangerous in Reverb G2 very nicely! Impressive.Its very portable, and looks professional.Regardless of Razer's infamous support and quality control, I think its a unique laptop that has improved over the years, and I am willing to keep buying Razer products in hopes that someday Razer will match Apple’s quality.",4
1877,Razer,Be careful You should make sure this is a new or used one because I got this item but I couldn't set up under my name. Key board does not work well sometimes. Button power is hard to use. So upset because this is a brand name but does not make me feel good,1
1878,Razer,"Battery failed after 3 months. The machine started reporting very wonky battery percentages. After a few days, windows didn't even report a battery being connected. Now the machine won't even turn on unless connected to power. Hopefully Razer support will offer me a replacement. If the support experience is stellar, I will update the review. But until then, my $3000 laptop is just a desktop.",1
1879,Razer,"Best all around Windows Laptop Fit and finish is second to none (including Apple).I really love the responsive keyboard and trackpad.The performance is outstanding.People complain about the heat sometimes without understanding the compromises being made.This thing has an RTX 2080 Super that crushes games at ultra settings up to 1440p resolutions.It will get hot during gaming.Mine hovers around 45 doing general tasks like youtube, email and browsing and the fans are dead silent.After tweaking, i'm seeing about 6hrs of battery life with the OLED panel at 60% brightness.Speakers are outstanding.OLED panel is outstanding.Not much more to say other than buy one if you can afford it and need the power.",5
1880,Razer,"Avoid this laptop! (Had to replace 3 times!) I would have loved to be able to write a good review because it's such a beautiful machine!But with so many flaws.. I had to replace my Razer three times before returning it entirely.First time the WiFi kept disconnecting, second and third time the laptop overheated so much to a point where I started smelling burnt metal. Now if you do decide to buy one anyway DO NOT get it directly from Razer!!! Go to a third party like Best Buy, that way you can always return with no problem. Reddit is full of horror stories about Razer's customer service. I later went and got an alienware and my God what a lovely computer.",1
1881,Razer,Razer is a Messy company Glitches errors and crashing. Black screens ETC. Stay away from this brand if you want something thats works properly.,1
1882,Razer,Best Windows experience you can get Coming from a MacBook Pro this was the first PC laptop that didn't feel like a cheap toy. It has the same build quality that you get with Apple products. It comes with a clean install of Windows with none of the junk that is normally forced on you by other manufacturers.I tried a Surface Book 3 and a Zenbook Pro Duo before settling with this Razer.,5
1883,Razer,"Best business/gaming laptop ever! Definitely a must for me. My job is mostly travel based so I needed a laptop that would fit in a business environment (to non-computer savvy people it looks just like a black version of the MacBook Pro minus the razer logo which can be covered up by a matte black dbrand skin and the rgb keyboard which I just set to white) as well as allow me to play my games when I’m away from home.Gaming: I get 180 FPS average on RS: Seige at 1440p ultra settings and no taa (it’s a blurry mess and only renders at half resolution so I keep it off) and the cpu never exceeds 80C and the 3080 never above 71C. The 14 inch screen is very pixel dense at 1440p so anti-aliasing isn’t needed for games which improves performance!Battery life: I’m super happy with the battery life. On better battery life with screen dimmed to 210 nits I get 14 hours battery life doing office stuff. At full brightness white point is at 350 nits which is good enough for in full sunlight viewing (also thanks to the anti-glare matte display coating, glossy displays would need to be 500 nit screens to perform as good.CPU: the ryzen 9 5900hx is very powerful yet sips the power and remains cool doing every day and medium duty tasks. So much so that the only time I’ve ever heard the fans start spinning is when I video game which is a big deal!Build Quality: the CNC machined aluminum body is amazing, very sturdy design (so much so I couldn’t believe it was also so thin), uniform black anodizing, and good clean lines. The only gripe is the finger prints. Black and dark colors are notorious for showing finger prints and oily smudges (which is why Apple went with grey color as it masks the fingerprints better) the 2021 razer blade 15’s got an added anti-fingerprint coating to combat this but unfortunately the blade 14 didn’t get the same treatment.My only other gripe is the rgb keyboard. For some reason your rgb settings are not saved to the bios instead the razer synapse software loads your rgb preferences after logging in to windows so I have to hide the rainbow keyboard during business meetings, etc until my white keyboard lighting gets loaded. RAZER, if you care about being the windows version of Apple (ie high end metal laptops for professionals that like to game) you need to fix 3 things:1. Make a sleeper blade 14 with the subtle stealth 13 razer logo.2. Either fix the rgb so it’s saved to bios so the keyboard doesn’t commence with unicorn vomit every time I open my computer or just make a blade 14 keyboard that’s just white leds.3. ANTI-FINGERPRINT coating!!!! Seriously, we are walking advertisements for your products and most people walking by and catching a glimpse of the laptop will be turned off by the guaranteed smudges and fingerprints on it. It’s impossible to touch this thing without leaving them all over it.",5

1887,Razer,"Solid Machine With Some Drawbacks I purchased this directly from Razer where currently it's much cheaper, but felt like contributing a review, as I believe some customers will find several of the tweaks below helpful.First of all, performance wise this is a fire breathing dragon. You will not be disappointed with the graphical performance. The display is very nice as well. It does get hot, especially around the WASD keys, but I haven't run into any issues typical with overheating computers (instability/locking up/shutting off). You'll want this off your lap if you're doing anything remotely demanding.There are some downsides to this laptop. The keys feel wobbly and took quite a bit of getting used to. The trackpad is nearly flush against the spacebar which makes it virtually impossible to type while its on, so I leave mine disabled.It comes with some questionable software installed, such as THX Spatial Audio. This is enabled by default and adds a layer of digital effects to all audio. It basically makes the speakers sound slightly flangy, as if they were placed on the other end of a tunnel. Personally I think it sounds awful, and I wasn't aware of the THX software at first and thought the speakers were just very low quality. Disabling this software improves audio quality by a huge margin. The speakers are also rather low powered, and do not output much volume even when cranked. They are THX certified, which I believe means they do not distort at high volume. Well, they aren't capable of high volume, so that was an easy certification to pass.There is a default setting for the trackpad that doesn't make much sense. It's called Click Lock and it activates on a click-drag. Once activated, it doesn't release the click event even if you let go of the mouse button, simulating a sticky button. I believe this is an accessiblity feature for people with fingers that can't hold a mouse button down for more than a second. For able-fingered people, it will just irritate you, and I question the logic of enabling features like this by default. I never knew about this Windows setting before, so I thought the trackpad was broken. It took quite a long time to figure this one out, and I nearly returned the laptop thinking it was defective.The battery life is beyond pathetic out of box, but there are settings you can change to more than double it. I found these tweaks on Reddit and you should search for them there; I don't want to repost them here because settings have a tendency to get shuffled around with updates and who knows when you'll read this review. Basically they amount to disabling Turbo Boost and changing a couple advanced power settings. It's very easy to do and will really enhance your battery life.Overall I'm happy with the power of this machine, but would have preferred a better keyboard with a well-position trackpad. I bought this primarily for game development and the keyboard is not great for coding, but it's workable. If you're only interested in the WASD keys, you won't have a problem.Overall 3.5/5. Solid machine with some drawbacks.",3
1888,Razer,"Two laptops, same issue out of the box, bad support - Ended up giving up on it and getting a refund I purchased this laptop from Micro Center. The first one had a screen flickering issue right out of the box. I immediately took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one. The next laptop had the exact same issue after just a few days. I decided this time to go through Razer support and replace it under the factory warranty. They took 3 to 4 days to respond to each email and continually would ask me to jump through more and more hoops. Weeks into emailing back and forth with them and the support team offering me nothing other than more troubleshooting steps that did not work, I decided I had enough and returned it to the store. Micro Center had a certified technician look at the laptop and called me back the next day to let me know it was indeed an issue with the factory hardware and something they've been seeing over and over again with these computers. They issued me a full refund and I ended up going with another brand. The laptops never worked properly and the support team was slow and seemed to be intentionally making it difficult on me. These laptops are now in a landfill where they belong. I have other Razer products I like but I'd NEVER buy a computer from them again.",1
1889,Razer,"Fingerprint Magnet, Heavy power brick THE GOOD:- 8 Core Ryzen ""Zen 3"" based CPU.- Solid RTX 3070 100W mobile GPU.- The lightest ""gaming"" laptop I've been able to find (under 4 lbs).- High refresh rate 144p- Silent even when gaming- Does very well at gaming and productivity.- TONS of ports.- Decent battery life.THE BAD:- Memory timings are very poor.- Memory not replaceable.- Barebones BIOS.- No DisplayPort option.- The power brick weighs as much as the laptop (I will try and grab the exact weight and edit this review).THE UGLY:Fingerprint magnet. RAZER PLEASE FIX.THE LOWDOWN:If you can find this laptop for MSRP ($2,199.99) it is worth it. Just be ready to clean it regularly.",3
1890,Razer,Speaker rattles and Razer's support is infurating Performance is great but the quality control is pretty terrible....,1
1891,Razer,"solid laptop pros:1) keyboard: razer laptops are still the keyboard I type the fastest on, also per-key RGB2) steady 100 watts, razer promissed 100, and it delivers, in game the GPU pulls a steady100 watts throughout gameplay. For comparison, the G14 promissed 80 watts, and even if you carefully manage CPU wattage, the G14 usually only delivers around 70 watts.3) even at 100 watts, the GPU temps never exceed 65 C4) battery life delivers: with updated graphics drivers, keyboard light off, screen at lowest brightness, and power saving mode on, I can get 16 hrs of video streaming on youtube. If you make some sacrifices and manage power draw well, this could be an all day battery.5) overall gameplay is really really good with very high 1% lows6) screen + touchpad are both low latency, which makes scrolling around a heavenly smooth experience7) CPU is 8 cores and can hit nearly 4.6 GHz. ""boost"" in razer synapse allows it to run at nearly 80 watts8) build quality: amazing. This laptop feels so solid in your hands with no flex whatsoever9) A breath under 4 lbscons:1) it does not come with the GaN charger that Razer has been sending to influencers with this product.2) CPU not cooled so well. I've seen it hit 100 C, and it often hovers around 90 in game3) RAM is awfully low bandwidth. Seems to work well in games, so maybe not an issue, but my RAM benchmarks have been pretty disappointing (especiallly considered it can not be replaced)Overall:A gaming laptop is for doing work, hobbies, and gaming with seamless transitions from your desk to on-the-go. For this, the cons I listed above are relatively small issues in the face of the pros which cover the important things, so I give this 5/5.",5
1892,Razer,"The Mighty 14"" Blade Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Let me preface this review with the person in the back saying, ""Oh, Razer is trash. Their products arrive defective and break easily,"" (ahem, battery bloat gate from Reddit) or ""There are way better laptops for the price,"" or the dreaded ""Razer needs to work on their technical support."" And though these claims may be true, imagine how many people buy stuff from Razer every day and don't write reviews versus the people who write negative reviews from their purchase experience. If you think about it, companies won't force consumers to write monthly reviews for their products. It would be nice info for your purchase decision, but not just Razer, but every company has their positive and negative side for their products and support.Based on a true story, when I received my XPS 15 9560 from 4 years ago and booted it up, it booted me to a black screen after setup and thought it was defective. And so, I contacted Dell support and told me to do these complex procedures and remotely accessed my laptop to download the necessary drivers. I was on the phone with them for an hour and a half to two and in my opinion, they were really nice about it and I appreciated their patience to assist me with my problem, but I ended up fixing it myself after the phone call with a clean install of Windows from a flash drive.Always make sure to do your research when splurging your money into a company. Also make sure to buy extra warranty to be on the safe side. I was stupid enough to not buy extra warranty since I'm a penny pincher, but all Blades should come with a 1-year warranty nevertheless. Just because a company receives a ton of bad reviews doesn't mean that all their customers write bad reviews. Some use their system without any issues, but only write reviews to express their problems with the product. In short, spend at your own risk and know what you're getting into! Otherwise, on to the review.What can I say, this laptop is gorgeous! Razer is definitely like Apple in the gaming laptop market. Thin, light, practical, and powerful for gaming and productivity. For reference the Blade 14 is about the size of a MacBook Air 13 from 2015. Not to mention, I always loved Razer's signature Chroma lighting on their products. I apologize for the quick video demonstration, but I set the keys to reactive lighting, and it never gets old!Other than the Chroma lighting, I also enjoy the practicality of the Blade. Though Razer advertises 12 hours of battery on it, I was only reading 6, even 3-2 hours with the screen at half brightness and half keyboard lighting with the screen at 165hz. But to make it up, it does come with USB-C charging, so you don't have to bring the beefy brick with you everywhere. Just don't expect to play games or do heavy editing as the USB-C port doesn't have full power like the AC adapter. Also to note, the USB-C ports don't come with Thunderbolt because of the Ryzen chips which is a bummer if you want to use Thunderbolt products or plug up an eGPU. However, with the RTX 3070, I don't think you'll be needing one for this laptop anyway.LAST THINGS TO NOTE WHICH IS IMPORTANT: The Blade 14 doesn't come with upgradeable RAM as it is fixed on to the board. This could be a deal breaker as many content creators obviously need more than 16gb of RAM, but for my usage, I never seemed to exceed 16gb. But a 32gb would've been nice to appeal for future proofing and to professionals that need a thin, portable, and powerful editing laptop.Performance wise, I love it as well! The buttery smooth 165hz screen is a game changer and makes 60hz look jittery. In games that I've tested, I was able to crank GTA V on QHD all on High settings and achieved an average of 70+ fps with 50fps being the slowest. If you want better frame rates (which applies to any game), I suggest dropping to 1080p. On NFS Heat, I got 70+ fps as well on the Max graphics settings on QHD. Alongside with NFS Heat, NFS Hot Pursuit Remastered yielded different results dipping below 70, going into 60fps in a busy area with QHD and Max settings. I have yet to test other games like Resident Evil 7 & 8 as well as Doom Eternal, but I imagine those games will perform really well with the computer's hardware.As for the laptop itself, it's thin and relatively light with beefy specs which therefore means it gets HOT while under full load. The top of the laptop near the screen gets extremely hot. It's normal as there are beefy components inside and in a 14"" form factor. I suggest investing in a cooling pad to sustain temperatures and preserve the longevity of the laptop. The palm rests also get warm as well under load since it's a single milled aluminum piece, but it doesn't bother me too much.While doing light tasks like watching YouTube and browsing the internet to chatting on Discord or doing video calls on Zoom, or doing schoolwork, it's relatively silent, if not, the fans do kick in and you'll hear a whoosh of air, but it's not obnoxiously loud. While under load, the fans do get loud, and even louder if you crank them manually in Razer Synapse.For the hardware like keyboard, touchpad, and speakers. I like them! I heard from many reviewers that Razer keyboards aren't the best as they lack travel and is a pretty big learning curve. In my opinion, keyboard taste is suggestive as I have no problem typing on it. Although I definitely notice the keyboard differences coming from an XPS 15 9560 as it does lack some travel and is grid-like, you'll get used to it in no time! For the touchpad, it's Windows Precision! No questions asked. And as for the speakers, they're alright. I've heard better from MacBook speakers, but I'll give it to Razer for making them front facing.Overall, I love my Blade 14!! It's a mighty laptop from performance to portability. Though it does have its downfalls such as having limited support from a small company, getting pretty toasty during heavy load, no Thunderbolt, lower than advertised battery life, and fixed RAM with no larger options, for me, it's the perfect laptop that suits my needs! Do I recommend it? Heck yeah!! Is it for everyone? Not necessarily. Is it unique and different from any other laptop manufacturer? Yep!",5

The build quality is exceptional, the case is +, etc., and using the box offline is fine in terms of speed, but loading web pages, getting hung up on web pages, etc. is just plain BS.

It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers, especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise, and if you don't use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop. It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use.

1939,Mediacom,"Good value.. but I bought this for a 2 week vacation trip to Costa Rica.I wanted something in place of my 13"" MBP that would be OK if it got lost, broken or stolen - I would be staying in inexpensive hotels, there are parts of CR that are a bit dodgy, it rains a lot this time of year where I was going.I was taking a carry-on only and keeping that in hand when transiting around so losing it wasn't too likely.The L410 was certainly OK and worth the price.But, I definitely missed my MBP.A couple criticisms of the L410:1. I VERY much rely on the back-lit keyboard on my MBP.The first thing I tried on the L410 was the back-lit keyboard.It worked fine.I then applied the numerous Windows updates, downloaded a couple apps (Geany, Filezilla, etc) and found that the back-lit keyboard had stopped working.I Googled it and couldn't find a fix (the most promising looking recommendation to download the ASUS System Control Interface driver was a dead end).I assume the software will get fixed eventually and it will start working again by itself, but the trip is over.2. The L410 speakers have been criticized multiple times here on Amazon Reviews, but they are even worse than I imagined.I am now watching movies on my MBP that I had watched on the trip and am hearing a lot I missed on the L410.If you think you'll be say, watching movies a lot, you might try bring headphones.The speakers were OK for a Zoom call though.3. I don't know if the keyboard layout is standard Windows, but the position of the Ctl and Fn keys on the left make it very difficult to use in one-handed key combinations.Also, I know I'm used to the shallow stroke of the keys on the MBP, but I much prefer their travel and clickiness.4. The trackpad is not bad.It is fairly responsive and accurate.It has quite a bit of downward play that takes some getting used to.I prefer the non-click-just-touch operation and it worked sort of OK - not great but most of the time.But Asus really needs to provide a way to disable the keypad overlay.It all-to-easily gets turned on (indicated by the LED in it's upper right corner).Then you don't notice it until the trackpad becomes unresponsive as a (mouse) pointer device.I tried deleting the driver for it but the driver returned (I guess in a save-the-user-from-himself Win10 process).I found a somewhat convoluted set of steps on how to disable it permanently, but Asus really needs to make it easier to disable.All in all, a good value at $260 but next trip, I'll probably risk it and bring the MBP.",4

1941,Mediacom,"visual studio installs! while this review is otherwise early, i thought it worth noting that the process of upgrading from windows ""S"" security mode and installing visual studio, and an array of hardware and software development apps has gone smoothly. i was concerned about the processor meeting the minimum requirements since i had little understanding of these new variable ratings - the geekbench rating is about 16 times higher than my old toshiba ;)while i haven't made sufficient observation of processor speed beyond use during setup, i haven't found any frustration with the speed of these operations. tbh i'm pleasantly surprised to have installed some older 32 bit apps such as synthedit and ones i wrote with borland's 90's fclt compiler and see them run without prejudice.the overall size is close to my aged toshiba netbook, except that it's light and quiet and probably tougher with the SSD. the pixels are so small i can hardly discern between them.i'm sort of amazed after earlier perusals to be able to purchase a functional development platform for $210. the only drawback i've found is that the keys and the work surface are all black, and the letters are thin, you can't see the key layout when its dark, i understand people are used to fancy backlit keys, i'd just recommend a colour contrast.lovely thing.",5

1959,Mediacom,"Holy Moly This is...great.To be clear, it isn't a top 1% of all laptops laptop.There are some compromises made, especially out of the box, however once it's set up I find I can play pretty much everything with no trouble.And yes, that includes Oculus Rift S stuff (more on which in a moment).First, out of the box specs are, in my opinion, a bit lean in terms of RAM and storage space.Now while this may sound odd, keep in mind that gaming culture really does assume that the user is going to be adding and upgrading and modifying and all of that, so I mention this for informational purposes.First thing I did was increase RAM to 32 GB, and second thing was to add a 2 TB M.2 NVME drive.This does help things quite a bit.As an aside, for a purpose-built gaming laptop there sure are a LOT of screws holding the case together.That tells me this system design isn't like a Razer or Alienware that has maybe three screws holding the bottom cover on.This may be a small nit but it's still annoying.Anyway, I then spent about two hours getting rid of all the bloatware and updating the Windows 10 install.Then another hour or so installing various titles from my Steam library.Then I played.A lot.Simply put, this handled everything I threw at it.Zero problems with the Tomb Raider series at max settings.Arkham, yep.Bioshock, yep.And while I realize these are old(er) titles, they still have the potential to stress hardware at the highest settings, but no stress in this system.So already this is no compromise to my Dell G7.BUT, the 144 hZ screen has me playing supported games on the laptop itself and not through an external monitor.The screen colors and such are very good, brightness is good, and while it's not as immersive as a 30+ inch curved monitor it's certainly no slouch either.I LOVE the graphics card.True there aren't a ton of titles (yet) supporting ray tracing, but those that do look spectacular.Minecraft (yep, Minecraft) looks great here.And the system, once things are beefed up a bit via some work I did earlier, performs well under those expectations.Now then, all is not lollipops and rainbows here.We get into Oculus Rift S setup.On paper this system checks all the boxes for system requirements.BUT, it is missing a dedicated DisplayPort.Oh, I know what the specs say, but DisplayPort functionality here is handled via a Thunderbolt port.HOWEVER, that Thunderbolt port is NOT wired to the NVIDIA graphics card, so as far as Oculus is concerned it doesn't exist.After experimentation and many thrown items, I was able to get this system to work with the Oculus Rift S via a *powered* HDMI/DP adapter.I do have to ignore the little blurb on the Oculus software that says the system doesn't meet minimum requirements because, well, it's wrong.This system does work well with the Rift S and in fact performs better than my Dell G7.Battery life....hey, it's a gaming computer.Minimal at best.:)As for the extras, if you like red and black then this is your jam.No provision in this model to change keyboard lighting.Bummer yeah.I'll overlook it based on heat management, inasmuch as this does a good job of staying cool.I like the hard key that gets me into the fan control, rather than having to memorize a function key combination.And of course, the entire physical system profile is thin and light.Plastic dominates the construction of course, but it's made solid enough to handle a lot of carrying around.Only nit there is the plastic itself does tend to show fingerprints and smudges more than I thought it would.So.As a gaming laptop it does pretty much everything a non-professional gamer would expect.Upgrading and modding is hit or miss and I wish there weren't 1,186 screws holding the bottom cover on.The, well, disappointing wiring of the Thunderbolt port is very frustrating (honestly, is it that big of a deal to have it connect to the graphics card too, not just intel...?) and gave me a headache that could have been avoided.BUT, at the end of the day the system handles a lot.Sound, graphics, etc are great.True they may not impress the gamers who have endorsement deals, but then this isn't aimed at them.This is a laptop aimed at people like me, who want to enjoy gaming without it being their job.And at that, it succeeds brilliantly.",5

1975,Mediacom,"not great for older eyes, otherwise a good machine Dell needs to find some senior citizens to test their products.The keyboard, which is gray letters on silver keys, would be better with higher contrast. In some light situations it is very hard to read them. In bight light it helps to turn off the keyboard light.The default setting for font size is also small. In fact, in the setting 150% is recommended by the program. At least it doesn't cut off on emails when the font is set larger as an older Dell machine did 6 or 7 years ago, when enlarging font was really just a zoom feature.I like the option to have color added to the cursor, which makes it easier to find.The screen is bright, and seems good for post processing photos and videos. The larger screen has a narrower edge, so the overall size difference is not much.Like many modern laptops it could use more ports, I'm having to use a hub, especially since I need a mouse because of arthritic hands.The machine is quiet.",4

1998,Mediacom,"Read reviews before buying, might be perfect for me but not you If you are someone who needs to use applications on this laptop to do work, this laptop is not for you. Normal Microsoft Office usage is not a problem, but I mean gaming applications like Minecraft, or other software for animation, video editing, etc. The storage on this laptop is too small to run those kinds of applications. In honesty, I would recommend investing in a laptop with high RAM for those kinds of things. The free year of Microsoft Office is a bonus, but I'd honestly just used a web-based service like Google Docs or the online Microsoft Suite (changing the settings to work offline). Using web-based applications will help the laptop run faster and work better.This laptop is ultimately best for surfing the web, social media, or writing papers. The storage space is not fit for anything else.As for the portability of this laptop, it's great. It's lightweight and very thin for it's price (on top of aesthetically pleasing!). It is NOT touchscreen -- the listing mentions that it's not touchscreen but the Amazon reviews prompt asked me to write about it. As for battery life, it's fine and lasts a while if you're using it for basic tasks like writing or surfing the web, which is what this laptop was made for anyways. I've only had it off the charger 4 times, so I can't speak on longevity, but it's lasted when I've had the laptop off the charger. I'd recommend this laptop for those who are looking to do basic laptop tasks or someone who is new to technology.My tips to make the most of this laptop and make it work with your budget:1) Uninstall bloatware and any unneeded apps like Netflix, Skype, etc2) I recommend using the browser version of apps like Netflix, Zoom, WebEx, etc instead of installed versions -- both require internet but one takes up significantly less storage3) clear cache often4) get a wireless mouse",5

2010,Mediacom,"Muy buen articulo, muy bien. Muy buen artículo, solo algunas rayas en la carcasa , hasta el momento el Mac a funcionado muy bien, la batería está muy bien.",5
2011,Mediacom,It didn’t work It didn’t work and so happy to get it and it doesn’t work,1
2012,Mediacom,Horrible This Macbook came on and would freeze up. I had to restart several times. Then I turned it on the final time and it appeared as though it had been cleared of its software or something. It would only show a question mark when I turned it on. I googled the message and that is what the question mark stood for. Something about a disk reload. Apparently this one had not fully been refurbished.Amazon it supposed to refund me my money. The price was good but maybe a little to good.,1
2013,Mediacom,"Not perfect, but pretty good This is the 2nd refurbished Mac I've bought from Amazon.It works great for my needs, I'm sure if you are a coder or gamer you may need the new features.However, for the money this is a great MacBook that works well and looks great.",5
2014,Mediacom,Lasted just past return window. Not worth it. I waited to review. Product pretty new in appearance couple scratches nbd. Lasted one month after return window and now it won’t turn on for $400+ i should have just bought a new one.FML,1
2015,Mediacom,Do NOT Buy I was expecting the laptop to work well. Ordered and was delivered earlier than expected. I was like “great”. Looked at laptop and noticed a weird sticker on the top and bottom “hmm”. Plugged in laptop and it refuses to turn on. I feel scammed. I would give it 0 stars if possible.,1
2016,Mediacom,Decent for the price but the mouse touchpad is a mess. Pretty much what you’d expect from a $300 refurbished laptop. The mouse touchpad screws up so much that I had to buy a wired mouse to use instead. A few of the keys on the keypad are worn out and have to be hit pretty firmly to work.,3
2017,Mediacom,Great Laptop!!!! Exactly what I was looking for in a lap top.,5
2018,Mediacom,don't miss a beat the battery life is the best.its just like having my phone but with a key board,4
2019,Mediacom,"great for basic needs Lightweight. Good battery life. Just if you need to use Microsoft Word, it does not give you full capabilities. My husband needed Times New Roman font, but it was not available. We sold it to our daughter and he bought an HP Microsoft based 15"" and has what he needed. If you're mostly shopping, checking social media, banking etc. It is great.",4
2020,Mediacom,Great laptop A great computer for your kids who have virtual learning. Its fast and battery life lasts and the best part is the communication between the student and teacher are very clear no lags and it can keep up with all the tabs that needs to be open . I would recommend to computer for any child in Google classroom.,5
2021,Mediacom,It's easy to carry and battery life is excellent I'm soon to be 46 years old not very good with a computer and I've recently decided to go back to school well since the covid 19 everything's online now this chromebook has helped me do this it's extremely lightweight the battery last through all my classes and I'm finally reaching my goal,5

2025,Mediacom,Great picture and sound! Purchased this for a gift for my teen and this is maybe the best laptop she has had before! One of her favorite features is that she can actually play her roblox on it! The keyboard lights up which is a plus for her and plus I use it time to time! Also very good price compared to the others. You will be pleased. Good for gaming and working if home.,5
2026,Mediacom,Another great laptop from Asus! We bought many Asus laptops for our clients!This one is really light but with 15.6 inch screen. powerful processor good for business applications!,5
2027,Mediacom,Brand new and keyboard doesn't work Straight out of the box and already found that the keys G H E and number 9 don't work. Tried everything including factory reset and reinstall drivers. This doesn't give me much confidence for longevity of this laptop. Returning now and finding something else.,1
2028,Mediacom,Muy buena relación precio calidad Cumplieron con lo solicitado en tiempo y forma,5
2029,Mediacom,A Bargain for the Price I use this for research so use a stupidly large amount of memory.The speed and memory are everything I'd hoped for.The screen is nice and big.I wish i owned two.,5
2030,Mediacom,Stuck pixels out of the box There was some stuck pixels right out of the box. Requesting a replacement will change review if fixed. Everything else is working fine. Fan is kind of loud.,1
2031,Mediacom,"Inferior product Caution do not buy this product. Screen went out on mine after only 8 months. My granddaughter bought same computer, her screen had same exact problem after only 4 months.",4
2032,Mediacom,"Possible bait and switch Received the laptop to find that every component was incorrect. It had 4gb of ram instead of 8, the weakest intel cpu I have ever seen instead of the AMD Quad Core R7-3700U, 57 gb of storage instead of 512, and integrated intel gpu instead of the AMD Radeon Vega 10. I will change my rating if the seller fixes this mistake.Be sure to check all of the components when your machines arrive everybody!",1
2033,Mediacom,"DO NOT PURCHASE from Janine on August 19, 2021DO NOT PURCHASEThe computer was great.... Until it wasn't. At around 14 months after purchase, the computer would not charge anymore. I knew the warranty ran out after 12 months, so I brought it to a local repair shop. The diagnosis was that the motherboard needed to be replaced, the repair place told me it would cost around $500 to repair and suggested I reach out to Lenovo. The local repair shop also mentioned that this was a common problem with this specific laptop. I called Lenovo and they said my warranty had expired and there was nothing they could do for me. I got 14 months out of a $650 computer. Don't waste your money! You've been warned.",1
2034,Mediacom,Great for the granddaughter. It is what I hoped for in a laptop/tablet. Like it and the granddaughter likes it for her school work.,5

2038,Mediacom,"Unintelligible Sound Quality on Zoom I was excited to find a mid- range laptop with a touch screen and ability to use like a tablet.I don't do much that requires a lot of computer power and Zoom is probably the most demanding thing I do.The first one I received had sound issues on Zoom ( echoes, pinging sounding underwater) that were so bad I could not be understood.Thinking this was a defective laptop, I asked for a replacement.The replacement has the same issue!So it's a design problem.I did not have this problem on Microsoft teams but I mostly use Zoom and I think any new laptop should be configured to work well on this popular platform for virtual meetings.My 9 year old laptop works well on zoom.So this one is being returned and I'll look for another good deal on a different laptop.",2
2039,Mediacom,"This Item Does NOT Have a Manufacturer's Warranty, Buyer Beware Delivered April 29th, it sat in a box until three days ago when my wife was getting it set up for school.It had been opened one time before that to turn it on and see if it worked, and then plugged in to charge.Today she opened it up and the screen literally fell out of the housing and cracked.I have no idea what type of failure happened in QA or manufacturing to cause this but this laptop had been touched literally three times prior to breaking.It had not left the house, it hadn't been dropped, mishandled, bumped into, or anything else that would cause damage such as it currently has.As it is outside the return window for Amazon we had to contact customer support at Lenovo who promptly told us that this item is not covered for hardware under the manufacturer's warranty, only software was covered.The only way to remedy this situation is for us to pay to ship it to Lenovo, pay to have them fix it, and pay to ship it back.Cross shipping was not offered to us, my wife starts school next Monday and we have no laptop for her now because of this absolute nonsense.Never again Lenovo, not a cent from my family or friends.I've dealt with some shady garbage from vendors before but this honestly takes the cake for generating sheer outrage.In summary, do not buy this product or any other from Lenovo unless you buy it with a credit card and can charge back if required, or it comes from Costco where they'll eat crap so you don't have to.",1
2040,Mediacom,"Battery problem the first 6 months. Fan died in a little over a year Do NOT buy this product, it is disposable. Nice features but it breaks in no time. 5 months after I bought it I had to replace the battery.

2041,Mediacom,Good performance Good performance,5
2042,Mediacom,"Fantastic Seller I received this item in July so this is a later review. For electronics I always like to wait at least a month to see how they fare.Well this one has done above and beyond my expectations. Everything is exceptional.The touch screen is sensitive to the pen but just sensitive enough with finger touch thatit recognizes if you're purposefully using touch or if it was an accident.Screen quality is gorgeous for the price! I play around with astronomy and other types of things that require high resolution and I have no problem with the quality this laptop provides.Battery life is surprisingly longer than I expected it to be....I may not do much gaming but I do a lot of blender, etc. And I get a good 4-6 hours when pushing it to render etc. On average I'd say it could definitely handle at minimum 6-8 if doing light tasks etc.The seller reached out to me before I even received the shipment to make sure I knew they were available and willing to help with any questions, concerns, or if there had been any damage during shipment. They reached out once again after I received the shipment to make sure I received it and repeat what they said before....I am 100% grateful that the seller was so thoughtful in this manner, and apologize, if you're reading this, for not responding. I meant to respond to your amazon messages but always had something come up, and then I'd lose the information as I have it set in my inbox to delete after reading.Tl;DrGreat Seller, great product, sensitive but not too sensitive touch screen, nice battery life 4-6 with hard work and 6-8 with small tasks. Will definitely buy from seller again!Will post photos at another time...also they sell screen guards for this..and I highly recommend them!",5

2047,Mediacom,it's refurbished aka waste of money 😩 It gets the job done I guess. It has kinks that need to be worked out but other than that it's an okay chrome book.

2054,Mediacom,Amazon Deal - Lenovo ideapad flex 5 I previously commented extreme frustration with not receiving this item on the date designated. The USPS was contacted early the next morning and we were able to pick it up. The item itself is FABULOUS just as advertised. I apologise for my snappiness. I am considering the purchase of a second for a family member. Lenovo has NEVER let me down. Come to think of it...neither has Amazon Prime! Thank you both!!!,5
2055,Mediacom,"A Perfect Chromebook This chromebook is perfect: nice screen size, FHD resolution, touch screen, fast processor, full keyboard, small enough to carry around, powerful enough to almost replace my Windows laptop. Great price too. I added a mouse.",5

2057,Mediacom,A very good value indeed Use this lenovo chromebook for everything except printing It's fast.reliable and has a wonderful backlit keyboard. Can use it ouside. What a value!,4
2058,Mediacom,"Does not support Microsoft apps I got this for school and LOVED it, but I sadly had to return it after the IT guy explained to me that chrome books don’t work with Microsoft Outlook, etc. so be mindful of that when purchasing one!",5
2059,Mediacom,Great Exactly what I needed,5
2060,Mediacom,"First Chromebook a disappointment I was excited to purchase a Chromebook for the first time this summer but didn’t get a chance to try it for a weeks after purchase due to travel. Set up was super easy as advertised but much to my disappointment, the machine goes haywire and opens and closes applications one out of every three uses. Sometimes chrome zooms in and the browser window shakes. I feel like it could cause a seizure for someone. I am only using it for surfing the web a have very basic needs it can’t even meet. I am fairly tech savvy and tried basic troubleshooting plus a factory reset. Still the same issue. Unfortunately I called Amazon after the 30 day window and they said they can’t help and won’t accept an exchange. Lenovo support said they won’t replace either. I would not purchase this product again and am disappointed I can’t get a replacement after only having it for 7 weeks.",1
2061,Mediacom,"Had it up and running within minutes! We bought this for our grandson who is starting college. I had the device unpacked and had it up and running within minutes (after connecting the charger). Worked perfectly. Great keyboard and display. Fast. Should do 99.9% of what he will need in college. I am an IT pro with decades of experience and have my own (non-Lenovo) Chromebook and I find the Chromebook is my go-to machine and there are only a few things I am not able to do on it myself. The Lenovo Chromebook seems very solid. Great price, great machine.",5
2062,Mediacom,Does NOT support Canon some printers!!! I am not happy so far with the Chromebook. You have to go to settings every time to pin app to tool bar. Can't figure out how to add to desktop everything saves to Google drive. I had great expectations for this product but then the printer issue. In a time were you can print from almost anything that connects to Wifi this does not support Canon MX920 series. And I can NOT get through for help. Went to Lenovo site and was bounced around by a virtual assistant that did not understand need to connect to printer. I am now seeking help from Amazon customer service. Hopefully I will have a more positive update in the coming days. But honestly I should have stayed clear of this went with another PC product.,2
2063,Mediacom,My rating of the laptop I returned the item because I couldn't use my current information from my other Laptop and the manufacturer was not able to help me out.My rating is a minus 4.,1
2064,Mediacom,Don't buy this computer It runs so slow I would not recommend it to anyone.Unfortunately I bought the same model for my grandson and it is just as slow.I am totally disappointed in both of them.,1
2065,Mediacom,new dell nice laptop,5
2066,Mediacom,Disappointing Windows explorer is constantly freezing.Doesn't smoothly run games with high graphic detail.Display color is kind of ugly - makes everything look all dull and gray.,2
2067,Mediacom,computer Like,4
2068,Mediacom,Easy to start up Great value for student!,5
2069,Mediacom,I enjoy using this laptop everyday as a way to keep in touch with the outside world! I really love this laptop. It was very hard to find but it was well worth it in the end.I basically use this laptop for my general everyday writing as a journalist and for my own personal uses on the personal side of my life for general writing.And is great to watch YouTube and stream videos on.,4
2070,Mediacom,Would recommend The laptop is quick and processing time for online WiFi transactions is quicker than my last computer. The battery life is sufficient for what we do. In addition setup was easy And did not take much time to get the computer up on the WiFi network and downloading updates.,5
2071,Mediacom,Price is right Arrived quickly via Prime; great value.,4
2072,Mediacom,So far so good! Just came in! After I struggled to get the screen protector off it looks way better! Will update once it charges and I see how thr battery life is,3
2073,Mediacom,"good value for the price the product is (untill now) in good condition and a good value for the price.256G disk, 8G memory and windows 10 pro? c'moooon, its a steal for 320",5
2074,Mediacom,Looks great but UNRELIABLE. Do not buy The design looks great but this thing just died on me after 8 months of very light usage.Used it maybe 2x week for emails or photo editing. Now screen won't even turn on. Going back to well established brands.Even the $150 Lenovo this replaced had less issues.,1
2075,Mediacom,Cheap Very cheap plastic computer. My charging cord broke within 2 weeks so I can’t use it until I can find another cord,2
2076,Mediacom,"Mostly As expected - prior concern was misunderstanding of upside down microSD slot. But... I don't know how to delete my prior less than stellar feedback. It appears the micro SD slot works, but is simply upside down compared to every other micro SD slot I have ever used. I thought it was broken.Otherwise the machine appears to work as advertised.Update: Unfortunately, the ""G"" key is not right, and is permanently pressed so a slight tough activates it without the solid click the rest of the keyboard exhibits. This is a bummer, given I have already installed and activated hundreds of dollars of software licenses that I cannot re-install on a replacement machine. Bummer.",3
2077,Mediacom,Good laptop for the price So far the device works exactly as told. Saw some review that says the item isn’t the correctly displayed but I got exactly what it said. Computer is light works well and has everything I need mainly for business and school needs. I recommend anyone who’s looking for a good deal on a light laptop to get this one. Screen amazing 14.1 inch as well battery life is good.,5
2078,Mediacom,"The F7 plus3 doesn't look like the advertised images. The f7 plus 3 does not have a lighted keyboard. I thought it did because I saw lighted keyboard images in the reviews.Also, the display itself does not look like the display in the image advertised.",2
2079,Mediacom,Laptop I received has longevity issues no Internet access after a short period of time. After very little use the computer will no longer connect to the Internet. It will connect to my router but won’t get Internet access. All my other devices work just fine on the Internet. This one will not work at all anymore.,1
2080,Mediacom,"Not a long lasting computer This laptop worked well for what I needed it for-primarily work duties at first.However after only a few months of use, the touchpad has gone haywire and is basically unusable.",1
2081,Mediacom,Very good It does what I need it to do. Only wish Ram could be upgraded,4
2082,Samsung,"Stunning Display and fast processing Compared to many other laptops in the current crop of ""lightweights"" the Samsung Galaxy 15"" (Non-touch screen version) is a very nice machine.Like others have stated, the plastic bottom shell is kind of flexible when used on your lap or a soft support, not a big deal on a desk.If it was done to save weight I don't think it makes sense as there are other metals that would be a good alternative.And I will agree, the blue color, while stunning, is a finger print magnet.The other limitation is only one USB 3.0 port.For these two reasons I gave it a four star rating.The system boots quickly, has a good suite of Samsung software, the driver and platform software update being a very nice add in, similar to the Lenovo Vantage update software.Windows is quick, video is great and it plays nicely with most apps including streaming of video.I would not throw a high-end game at it though, not a big enough pool of video RAM for that.",4
2083,Samsung,Quality product Build quality is very good and the screen is clear. Very lightweight.,5
2084,Samsung,Worth the money Has an exquisite display which is worth the money,5
2085,Samsung,"No touch screen on this model and is thin plastic charge like a cell phnoe Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I just got it today it’s charging it get very hot when charging one port for printer or mouse it is not touch screen, I’m not sure if the fingerprint reader took after about 7 tries it ask me to put a PIN number it is very thin and plastic top still deciding if I will keep it. It charge like a cell phone",2
2086,Samsung,"Great Laptop! Must get! Very powerful for an ultra book, great battery life, gorgeous screen. Low key travel but very clicky.",5
2087,Samsung,"Great laptop with one important issue I've been using the laptop for some time, and overall I pretty like it except for one issue that is sure to be a deal breaker for some people.I'll start with the good things first. This laptop is ridiculously light. Even after some time of using, I would still be shocked by how light the laptop is everytime I picked it up. If you will be on the go for most of the time, this machine is perfect.Next up, the keyboard and touchpad. I dont really know how to describe the keyboard feel, but you sure will not be disappointed. as for the touchpad, its ok, nothing spectacular. But the size of the trackpad is very big, allowing for a more comfortable use. I'll give it a pass.One of the best features of this laptop is the screen, but ironically is also what most people would be complaining. The colors of the amoled screen is ridiculous, and it is great for watching movies and other stuff. However, the screen is only a full hd. Although i was hoping for at least a 2k, you know I'm not complaining simply for how good it looks.Ports: I never thought that i would need to label this as an advantage, but it indeed is. This machine packs a HDMI and full size USB-A into the slim body. Not something you see very often today.And now the bad things, and it would say it is not necessarily a design fault, but rather a compromise for having a laptop at this weight. The chassis of the laptop is simply just too soft and thin. Here are some real world problems i face when using the GBP.when i pick up the laptop in a closed orientation, sometimes i could click the trackpad. Yes, from the bottom of the chassis. You also cannot comfortably use it while it is on your lap, cause if you apply to much force on the side the trackpad will also click. Also, when typing, if you press the keys down too hard, you will bend the chassis.So overall would I recommend the Galaxy book Pro? I would say yes, but only if:you are willing to sacrafice some build quality for weight and portablityif you want to stay in the samsung ecosystem and don't find the flexible chassis a big issue.You want a powerful windows ultrabook and portability is absolute top priority.You really like vibrant colors and will be consuming a lot of media on the device.",4
2088,Samsung,"Fast, beautiful, but hard to recommend There are so many things I love about this laptop. The screen is so gorgeous you'll weep, even if it's pretty low-resolution.I love the size and how light it is. I've read that it's got plastic parts, and much of it does feel plastic, but if so, it's a good plastic that adds to its lightness.It's incredibly thin. Like, science fiction thin.The processor is fast enough that I don't see a hiccup at all ever.It comes with Windows 10, of course, but support for other operating systems is a mixed bag. It runs Windows 11 like a dream, but Linux does not support many of the hardware features.When I first got it I was a bit bummed that it has a fan. But it's nice that it offers the ability to control the fan--you can throttle it down so that the fan never runs or increase it so the fan goes nuts.I love the feature that stops the battery from charging fully. If you keep your laptop plugged in for long periods the battery will degrade over time. The Galaxy Book has an option to keep it from charging past 85%, which is brilliant for keeping the battery healthy longer.The fingerprint scanner is neat and works great.Still, despite the glowing above, I would have a hard time recommending this to anyone, and perhaps not the reason you'd think. Yes, the camera is atrocious, and yes, Samsung does have some bloat, and yes, the insistence on using it with other Samsung devices is half-baked at best and kind of dumb. This is all to be expected on a Windows device anymore.The reason I would not recommend this laptop is it is inherently unstable.In Windows 10, it has a tendency to start to go to sleep for no reason, and continue to go to sleep while I'm typing, and then try to go to sleep again right after that. I have yet to figure out why this is, though turning off sleep while the lid is open seems to fix the problem. (It goes to sleep when the lid is closed, and I've taken to using hibernation more often.) I've attempted to contact Samsung with this issue but they were unable to pinpoint a cause and I'm thinking, unfortunately, it may be a hardware issue, as it has survived multiple wipes.If it sounds like I'm whining, you're right, I totally am, but it's also an issue that I fear might be endemic to this laptop. If so, I would steer clear; this laptop is very, very expensive and at this price you deserve regularity and rock-like stability--things I've seen done better in laptops that cost less than half as much. I can't guarantee you'll tear you hair out as I have done, but you'll be taking your chances.If you do decide to go for it, and if it is more stable than my review unit, it may be the best laptop ever. As it is, I just sort of look at it wistfully and think about what could have been.",4
2089,Samsung,"fast and very light laptop, beautiful screen, hinge not solid therefor touchscreen not good usable",4

2092,Samsung,"Great Form Factor, but very annoying quality issues I love the slim form factor of this computer and it still feels sturdy.I absolutely love that the computer has no fan, so using it in bed or with covers is not going to smother it an cause issues.My two issues were this: the right USB port didn't work right out of the box, so I immediately had to ship it to New Jersey to be repaired.The other issue is that I can't use the built-in speakers at any setting under 20%, which is the volume I usually listen at when I am in my relatively quiet house.....the only time you would actually use these instead of headphones. They make this really annoying popping sound constantly.",3
2093,Samsung,Best price Nice looking laptop with super portable and lightweight. I got this brand-new device with the best deal of the day. Total price with tax is about 594.29 USD.,5

2095,Samsung,La recomiendo Hasta el momento todo ah ido bien! Es una laptop super delgada y bonita!,4
2096,Samsung,"A Good Buy!!! After a little more than 8 months I can say that the computer is perfect in every way. Try installing various low-performance games such as age of empires or age of mithology and it runs quite smoothly and hardly warms up. After a while I uninstalled them, since to play there are always other types of computers more prepared for games than this is going to be a work computer. As for the Image Samsung has done a great job (as we are always accustomed to in its panels) being able to play videos in 4K, although the quality does not reach those levels, it seems it. Regarding the Sound section, AKG once again does a great job making a very good stereo sound, without losing quality even by raising the volume to the maximum. As for the battery section, I was quite impressed by the fact that I was able to reach 12 hours of work and put the computer to charge, still remaining 9% battery. After more than 8 months, as is normal, now the battery does not reach 11 hours. If you have to put problems with this computer, it would be the keyboard lighting, which is quite weak and another defect is that Samsung has not taken into account the Spanish market at all, since only keyboards in English, German or Italian are available leaving aside a language as important as Spanish.",5
2097,Samsung,"Light and quiet I bought the Rose Gold model for my wife. It is quite light and quiet which is great and the screen is bright enough for outdoor use as needed. The only ""complaint"" I have with it is that its RAM is limited to only 8GB. It doesn't have a slot for adding more RAM and the 8GB stick is soldered in so it is not replaceable. I knew this when I bought it so we can live with this circumstance anyway.",5
2098,Samsung,Best laptop I have owned Banging laptop - highly recommended.,5
2099,Samsung,"Extremely underrated laptop If you've seen the reviews for the Qualcomm version, you will read about underpowered processor speed and other comments about ""half-baked"" experiences.However, if you are looking to do huge amounts of video edits and computational / CAD design, then this type of device was never for you, anyway.If what you use a laptop for is web browsing, media consumption, and work in either Microsoft O365 apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) or Google apps, then this computer is amazing.Actual workflow is not slow or even any different. In fact, it is better as the computer instantly boots and logs on (just like an iPad or Android tablet), but with all the versatility of a laptop.And the battery life is crazy good!Beyond that, the keyboard is very good and easy to type.It doesn't have quite the ""clickety-clack"" of a ThinkPad or Surface, but it is as good as most laptops, and better than the butterfly keys of Macbooks of yore.Screen is incredibly bright, works well outside (there can be some glare, but nothing different than most glossy screens). The speakers are also excellent. If you use Edge (Chromium based) and mostly MS software, with the use described, then you will be very happy with this.",5

2102,Samsung,"Do not purchase via Amazon as the restocking fee if you need to return it is $140.00 It's beautiful and futuristic with its sleek solid built and fantastic screen.I liked everything about it except for the extreme heat that it developed randomly.It became so hot that I worried for its internals and it was too hot to be on my lap.That said, had I known there would be such an expensive restocking fee, I would have kept it.Actually, I would NEVER have bought it from Amazon!I lost $140.00 to Amazon's restocking fee and I'm still stunned.I must have missed this fact somewhere in the information.Expensive lesson learned.",3
2103,Samsung,"Great chromebook The 4K Amoled screen is better than great.The touch screen is fast.There is no fan so it does heat up.I would like more volume from the speakers, and better battery life. The problems are minor,and I really like this chromebook.",5
2104,Samsung,"TouchPad doesn't work. I am returning this computer. The TouchPad was unresponsive after using the touch screen or the computer was in use for any significant amount of time. This was a problem from the day I opened it (only had for a week). I tried all the troubleshooting options on the Samsung website, no improvement. I wish I had read more reviews before purchase...",2
2105,Samsung,"Disappointing but beautiful The laptop is pretty to look at and it's thin. The screen is a really nice quality but doesn't outshine a MacBook but maybe a little better than the pixelbool. When you use it as a tablet it doesn't close fully so it's floppy and you can't really hold it because the bezels are so small you're always touching the screen. A common issue many have reported is the touchpad which jumps all over but that's a software issue with other apps which are incompatible. I deleted a bunch and it worked but dunno which was the culprit.If you are buying this because you hope to use other Samsung devices with this seamlessly, well, my galaxy buds don't always pair with this and there is no interface which I was surprised by. In fact you can't use the apps for galaxy devices with this Chromebook.It doesn't recognize my Samsung phone even which my Google pixelbook does a slightly better job at. The fingerprint scanner works maybe 50 percent of the time because it doesn't pick up my fingerprints well. Battery life isn't great but it hasn't been too bad for me. It's fast and rarely have I seen it glitch. I would have returned it for sure if I was still in the US but I bought it and left the country. I bought it to replace my pixelbook wthoch I've beat up a lot but even in it's poor state I use the pixelbook 90 percent of the time.",3
2106,Samsung,"Very Happy with my Purchase I am currently using ASUS CP302 Chromebook which severed us well for 3-4 years and is still working fine. After that I got MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and with Mac's build quality I was really looking for a better Chromebook to replace by aging ASUS.I am very happy with Samsung's build quality and hi-res AMOLED screen is gorgeous. Touch screen with stylus is welcome addition. I am not an artist to judge this but with simple notes with Google Keep and Sketchbook App, I find it working fine.For build quality, specs, features and latest functionality improvement with Chrome OS I am very happy for my purchase and my decision for staying with Chromebook and not replacing it with MacBook Air M1 which is what I was considering. That would have been a full spec computer at higher price point. I already have options with me for full computer between MacBook and Windows/Linux desktops so that wasn't a big issue for me.",5
2107,Samsung,"Potentially a good Chromebook; spoiler: It's not. The device arrived with a disfunctioning battery and I had to send it back. This can happen. Bad luck. Before ordering another one I tested the device itself otherwise and it revealed that is not worth the money, hence I didn't order a replacement.Battery is truly horrible (which everyone warns about anyway, that's not a secret). Besides that I still recommend the follow up Samsung Chromebook 2, as I personally find it way better. Screen. Battery. Handling. Speed. Ease of use.",2
2108,Samsung,"Beautiful computer with FLAWS :/ Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I had it for around 3 weeks, everything was good at first but after week 2 the mouse track pad became unresponsive even after restarting it many times. Same with the touch screen, it froze on me many times. (Refer to video) Apparently this is a common issue on these laptops . Also I'm sure you heard it before but the battery sucks ! I was getting 4 hours max on ""regular use"" . Its a shame because i really liked the laptop, the screen resolution its amazing and the laptop feels VERY light and premium but having those issues in just 2 weeks its unacceptable.I had to return it.",2

2111,Samsung,"Great bang for your buck! Thin, lightweight, crystal clear screen, incredibly easy to navigate I could not be any happier.However, I would never do business with this reseller ever again. No where does it state that you will pay a 20% restocking fee, very deceptive business practices.",5
2112,Samsung,Pay attention to processor This is a quality piece of hardware but the listing says I7 processor. I received and I5. Return initiated.,1
2113,Samsung,Lightweight and Functional I’m amazed at how lightweight this computer is. Almost too lightweight in a sense that I forget it’s in my bag when I’m carrying it. The screen and sound are good. Nothing crazy high quality but good enough to watch a movie when your kids are stealing the three other TVs in the house. I mainly use it for teaching and normal home use and I love everything about it… EXCEPT… one small detail that is turning out to be a big annoyance. The shift key on the right hand side is tiny… I mean smaller than every other keyboard that I have ever used due to the thumbprint key. I wish I could get rid of it in place of a normal size shift key. Overall… I hate to say I wouldn’t buy this computer because of ONE key… but man… there have been many curse words uttered when having to backspace because I missed the shift key in the middle of typing.,4
2114,Samsung,"screan We have only had this computer since October 14, 2020, and last week the screen went out. After researching this computer mine is not the only one that this has happened to.",1
2115,Samsung,"“Simply the nicest laptop I’ve ever owned. Period.” I currently own six laptops, and have owned Latitudes, Elitebooks, XPS models, Pavilions, Surface Pros, Thinkpads, Envy’s, etc. This is the finest one I’ve ever owned, even though I never imagined buying a Samsung laptop!First off, it’s so very light. Secondly, I’ve never seen, much less owned, a screen so bright and deeply saturated. And when it turns on (about 4 seconds), and you hit F10, the colors go from gorgeous to unbelievable. Yes, the screen brightness is what I love most. And to get that Samsung QLED screen on steroids, well, it is unparalleled in color brightness. The high-end Elitebook with the 1000-nit screen was close, but it had what I call a ‘rolling shadow’ every time the screen was moved forward or backward. Not a flaw, just the way many were made. Not on the ION. Move that lid backward or forward and no ‘shadow’…ever.This bright screen does not hurt the battery much, either. The laptop won’t get 21 hours, but with fine-tuning it will last many hours. As others have noted, the sound is not great, but who really buys a laptop depending on its sound. I also love the tiny lighted (!) AC plug-in to the laptop, and the blazing-fast fingerprint reader is flawless.The 10th Gen. i7 processor just flies. Files copy really fast, and everything moves like it was 2023! Size-wise this thing is THIN. Slips into virtually any purse or protective case as smooth as butter. More than once I thought I was pulling out my iPad.The keyboard isn’t a Latitude, but it’s a pleasure to use. Brightly lighted too.Small negatives—the fan runs constantly, and the bottom gets pretty warm, even with the roll-under screen edge meant to increase airflow. Also, it’s not as inexpensive as others like it—especially now with a chip shortage. But that’s just the point. The Galaxy ION isn’t like others. It’s QUALITY Samsung-built, and much nicer than the Galaxy Flex. No comparison. And it doesn’t hurt that the reliability of Samsung laptops has moved them up considerably.Again, this is the nicest (and brightest!) laptop I’ve ever owned. And the lightest. I can’t find much about it to complain about. And…it’s beautiful!",5
2116,Samsung,"Laptop stopped working It just cannot boot, nothing happens other than the blue status light blinking when I press the power button. Samsung technical support in Canada where I reside claims that the warranty does not cover it here, as it is bought i the USA, although I was positive thee is an international warranty on these devices.After a lengthy exchange with Amazon and Samsung, I learned that international warranty does not exist, i.e. warranty is covered by Samsung only in country where the laptop is sold, but not country it is sold to.Here is Amazon's wording:""As I can see the International Warranty you are talking about is it is not answered by Amazon, that is why we need to reach out to the manufacturer to clarify because usually they are the one who are the one who handle the warranty not Amazon.I also checked the Product Detail Page and I don't see we offered International Shipping, you just saw it on the Q&A section which I confirmed that was answered by a random customer not Amazon nor Samsung"".As far as the laptop is concerned, it has a hardware issue and needs to be repaired, as diagnosed by Samsung US over the phone, so I will have to either pay for it as out-of-warranty repair here in Canada, or ship it to Samsung US, which would be costly and add time. I did notice from the start that battery life was nowhere close to advertised, so that might have been connected to the eventual breakdown.",2
2117,Samsung,Solid Awesome and great battery life,5
2118,Samsung,"Read this review you will thank me later pros- bright nice display, cool color change if look at from different angel, can charge some phones using mousepad, coolcharging light indicator on cord, though cord could be longer, fingerprint buttonsign in option , cord is small and thin and not bulky, very light can hold it easily in one hand, not hot like most laptops, boots up fast and shuts down fast, keys aren't real loud when typing, cooling fan isn't too loud.cons- speakers way too lowin sound because of the positioning of the speakers which are on the side or bottom it's kind of hard to tell the location but anyway quite low in volume, keyboard not smooth but kind of rough, no good audio software I was hoping samsung would have better software, they just used the standard windows audio package, I got rather spoiled on my old windows 7 samsung which has and still has the best software on a pc ive ever had, the mousepad could be improved as it's sometimes hard to control the mouse control and movement, NO TOUCH SCREEN, this was a big sad point for me cause I LOVE TOUCH SCREEN, this laptop most certainly needs this cause the mouse isn't that great. I can honestly say if the display wasn't so awesome I would have probably sent this laptop back but a good clear, good, bright display is very important to me. Samsung typically has good high quality displays. I just think for the price all the things I mentioned could have been included. I've never bought a laptop this expensive and was wanting more. I'd still buy it again as I haven't seen many high quality laptops as of lately.",3

The battery life is great too! I get about 8 hours of use outside before I even start thinking of recharging it. I did months of research to find a laptop that would have a screen brightness value of at least 500 NITs and this one seems to meet or exceed the value as I was only going to buy a laptop that I could use outdoors. If meets my investigative expectations! It has a slot for upgrading the RAM and I will go to 16gb total in a short while. So far, this laptop exceeds my expectations. If you want a laptop with a bright screen to use outside, consider this one!",5

2125,Samsung,Hard to see keyboard OK. Two complaints. Screen could be brighter. But main complaint is this hard to see keyboard. Its silver with white light thru the small letters/numbers.

2127,Samsung,"scratches easily I have had this computer for about four months. I got this computer as a replacement for the c302.- I like the computer, but it scratches very easily and looks bad for that reason. I have never had a device that scratches this easily. I take good care of the computer, but it has still accumulated a lot of scratches.- the screen attracts a lot of fingerprints. I have not had any issues with the screen flickering.- I like the case it comes with, but I'm not sure how much it actually helps.It would be nice to have a way to carry the plug or usb cable. I don’t want to stick it in the envelope case because I know that will scratch the computer further- The computer and the envelope case it comes with look stylish. I have received compliments from others about how beautiful it is.- it is much faster than the c302, and it better supports a large number of tabs being open simultaneously without performance decrease or crashing.- It is lightweight and very portable. I frequently carry it around as it is convenient and easy to carry- The battery life is not very good, but I have been able to improve it by turning off Bluetooth. the battery lasted about four hours with Bluetooth on, but with Bluetooth off and brightness slightly lower, I have been able to use it for an entire workday.- I like the adjustable keyboard brightness, but I do not like that the keyboard brightness settings change each time the computer is turned off or restarted. resetting the keyboard brightness each time the computer restarts is a little irritating and inconvenient",3
2128,Samsung,Difficult to open It is fine for my high schooler but if you have any dexterity issues this is NOT the right laptop for you.Very challenging to open the laptop.Personally I think the keyboard is too faint to see but again my kid said it was fine. He liked the keyboard backlight.,3

However, in the era of COVID-19, I have used this feature much less. Instead, I need a camera every day. This one shuts off randomly (in the middle of presentations even!) and won't work for weeks at a time. I will be doing a factory reset to see if that helps long term. I think there is an issue with the drivers & Windows 10. I've talked to Samsung & have researched message boards to no avail. If you use conferencing software for work and need to be on camera, I suggest looking for a more reliable machine.",2
2137,Samsung,Seal was broken Highly dissapointed as the seal was broken. Did not expect a used laptop when I paid about $1000 for a brand new one.,1
2138,Samsung,"Perfect replacement for my desktop. I have other compact laptops and tablets and they are fine for what they are designed to do. The problem I have with these is the screens are small and difficult to use in real productivity, hence, a larger screen. The Samsung Notebook 9 Pro fits the bill. This unit is a direct replacement for my desktop. that I can easily carry around on my travels. The screen is the brightest I have seen and the SSD hard drive makes it faster than my desktop. The facial recognition feature makes life so much easier. Flip the lid open, face scan, and boom, you're in about 10 seconds! No passwords, pins, fingerprint scans needed here. With the integrated S-Pen, I could not ask for more. On a special note, I purchased the Asurian protection plan. I am not a big fan purchased warranties but in this case, I am really glad I did. Spilt a drink on my keyboard and damaged the notebook. Called Asurian and I was impressed with the efficiency of thier service. No foreign speaker or hours of answering questions. My call lasted about 10 minutes. 2 days later the prepaid shipping box arrived. I received an email from Asurian that my notebook has been received by them. 6 hours later I get another email from Asurian that my computer has been fixed and shipped along with a tracking number. That was fast!",5

2140,Samsung,"Great laptop to investment in. This laptop is the perfect size for me at 14 inches. I can stream video or browse the web comfortably. A previous reviewer was right in that the onboard speakers are shit, so use earphones if you that matters to you. The weight is alright, a tad heavier than I'd like but it's pretty compact and travels well: I took it on a flight recently and it fit into my large handbag. I like that it folds over into a tablet but the size makes that a bit awkward for me because I have small hands, but I love the onboard stylus. There is no onboard webcam cover, unfortunately, so you may need to add your own.",4

2160,Samsung,"Get it for MIL STD testing, Battery Life and Wi-Fi 6 You can get a lot for 300.00 US today.For amusement, look at mini-PC's, which need external keyboard, mouse and display, but come with desktop-like capabilities and are expandable for more memory.Sure, they're not laptops, but the core machine is portable, in fact more so than a laptop, so long as your destination has the requisite keyboard, mouse and display.I disgress.For 300.00 US in this instance, you get a long battery life and good Wi-Fi 6, which could be essential for on-the-road journalism, student notes or remote lab projects.If you're an Android user, you get many settings and preferences moved automatically when you set it.Contrast that with Windows laptops, where more steps are needed to install the apps you need. (Partly this is because Microsoft abandoned their mobile platform.)Samsung made some compromises here, but sometimes you want bare bones.The machine might be used only occasionally, for children, or may need to be dedicated to a particular purpose, or is needed for public use and will get beat up. Finesse, higher cost, weight and power give you more features, but they are not always needed.I'd like to comment on the ""military grade"" aspect that is claimed, but I didn't see a way to test MILSTD 810G findings.Let's just say that this is a definite plus for many environments.PRO- Like most current Chromebooks, can use many different USB-C chargers, so long as they have enough wattage for this Galaxy book- Fast setup for Android phone users (as with all Chromebooks)- Good price point- Wi-Fi 6 will be noticeably faster for some users- Battery life is good (12 hrs may be a stretch though, depending on what tasks you throw at it)- 3 USB ports enables external mouse, keyboard, camera/mic (some laptops have fewer ports on their low end offeringts)- MILSTD 810G testingCON- Memory is limited- Screen isn't great at this below-HD resolution but it's fine for most tasks- It's very light, but at 14"", I wish it were closer to 11 or 12 for still better portability. Samsung makes smaller ones but not with these other features- You will miss having a touch screen as you come off your Samsung Galaxy phone- It's ChromeOS which won't have some apps for some users.",3
2161,Samsung,"Samsung Quality With Google Hype I generally don’t like Chromebooks. They are under-powered and for what they are overpriced. Mainly since so many students had to work from home, and demand for these spiked almost overnight.They started with the noble idea to be an affordable alternative to regular spec notebooks, got more expensive over the years, to the point of a price-bubble that pushed even older models into $500 territory. And still most think of them as an affordable option to ‘real’ computers.The reason why these are so omnipresent is because Google talked school districts into the idea that they are safe to use and easy to administrate. And while there are some really nice rugged models that are built to resist even the above average careless student abuse, many are just cheaply made low-spec laptops. Often using a privately used computer with a different operating system (Lubuntu on an older notebook works great) would do, but some school apps ask for some deep gripping admin rights on the computer. Something I personally don’t want to allow on a device for personal use.But here we are, the new school year begins and many of us parents would rather buy a Chromebook than use a dated one issued by the school. It's either sign up for a ridiculous expensive device insurance or sign to pay in case of damage.Our school district wants $350 to replace an over ten year old Lenovo in case of a total loss!So putting down the money for this Samsung actually makes sense. Especially since it’s reasonably priced. There isn’t too much to say about the specs. It’s there where it should be, and it works. Samsung is a good brand with a wide variety of products. From all the Samsung products we own and owned, they have been very reliable. I still have a 2014 Galaxy S10 that still keeps going after I handed it down to my daughter.The display is crisp and sharp, the battery life is good for a few hours off the plug, and the quality and feel is great and above average in this price segment. The fact that it looks like metal, but isn’t makes it IMO feel a bit cheaper when touching it. That’s a brain trick and wouldn’t be an issue at all with a solid colored case.The design is inline with the wedge-trend. I wish it would be more functional like older Dells, with the rubber edge and water resistant keyboard, but there are other good options to protect the device from hits and drops. This also means the keyboard is flat with very short travel, meaning the tactile feedback is flat rather than a press like on a traditional full size keyboard.I like that it still comes with a traditional USB-A (the big square) port aside the modern USB-C (small roundish) ports. That means it’s still able to handle older cables, thumb drives, etc. while USB-C gets rid of clunky proprietary power adapters. Also headphone jack!For myself as a parent I can only say: It sucks that options are so limited when it comes down to choosing devices, especially since I would prefer not to have Google peeking into my kids' school career, but for what it is, this is a good choice for a Chromebook; Especially for teens and older who prefer to have their own devices and some style along with it.So that’s five stars for the product, but with the call to all parents to always ask if there are options to using Chrome OS and if not, why?I hope this helps to make a decision.",5
2162,Samsung,"Good Battery Life, OK Screen This Chromebook is lightweight and cuts a slender profile. Aesthetically, it looks good with a familiar wedge shape in silver plastic with a black interior. It feels sturdy and rigid. The keyboard is nicely laid out and has good key action for typing. The trackpad is a decent size and tracks smoothly. The Chromebook charges via USB-C - wall charger and USB-C cable is included. There are two USB-C connectors, USB-A, headphone jack and microSD card slot. Battery life is quite good - I was able to go for an extended editing session for a few hours and still had plenty of battery left. It comes with 32 GB of storage which is sufficient for editing documents, spreadsheets, surfing the web or other lightweight tasks since most content is stored in the cloud. Performance is fine - it feels responsive and never left me waiting. Playback of 1080p streaming video is smooth. The one area of needed improvement is the display. Viewing angles are restricted and colors are not as saturated as they could be - but adjusted at the right angle it’s OK in use. On the other hand, the sound is good - nice midrange and high end, with a bit of bass. Overall, this is a nice-looking Chromebook that offers good battery life and performance for the price.",5
2163,Samsung,"Decent Chromebook, mediocre display, pretty quick for what it is, long battery life If you're in the market for a low cost Chromebook, and you're willing to live with a screen that's not the best, especially by today's standards, this might be a good option. If you must have a nice display, look elsewhere. The screen in this one is not IPS, and the viewing angles are limited, the resolution is only 1366x768.That said, everything else is good. It's quick, runs smooth, power through everything I threw at it. It streams 4K/60 content from YouTube without dropping frames. (you'll want an external display to appreciate it though!) Benchmarks are better than I expected given it's specs. Results were better than 70% of all users that ran the same benchmark, and 80% better then those using ChromeOS. I used it all day, then into the next and still had over 50% battery left, which it estimated to be nearly 8 more hours of runtime. I think the spec'd 12hr battery life is very realistic. Samsung did a good job tuning this one to get all it's potential, efficiently. Even stressing it like this it doesn't get hot, just barely warm. There's no fans or anything for cooling, so it remains totally silent.The keys feel good, though spacing is a little weird for me. I'll get used to it over time, I guess the same can be said for any new keyboard. The touch pad works well and is responsive. I like that it has a hardware button for clicking, or a tap will also work. It supports the usual gestures and all feels natural.Sound quality is surprisingly good. It's clear and loud with good lows, mids, and highs. The two speakers are down firing mounted in the bottom, and will get a bit muffled when using on a soft surface.The camera is just OK, not great by any means. It will do for Skype and the like, but that's about it.",4
2164,Samsung,"Disappointing display, but reasonable for the price The low-resolution display and washed out colors are the first things I noticed about this Chromebook. All in all, the display is just kind of disappointing. I know: It's a low-cost Chromebook, and so I should adjust my expectations appropriately. But still, it's hard not for me to get disratcted by the display.Also, I got the model with 32GB of storage. However, 13 of those 32 are used for the system, bringing the available storage down to 19GB. And then, I installed Linux, and the installer recommended that I set aside 10GB for Linux storage. So, now I'm down to 9GB of Chromebook storage. Of course, given that this is a Chromebook, one would not expect as much storage as one would finde on a Windows or Mac machine.Are you using this primarily for editing Google docs and watching YouTube videos? If so, you don't need much storage space (because documents are generally stored in the cloud), and the screen resolution is acceptable. But if you want a Chromebook with decent specs, including a sharp image and plenty of storage, this most definitely is NOT the Chromebook you should be considering alternatives.",4
2165,Samsung,terrible screen low quality screen,2
2166,Samsung,Was NOT touchscreen. ,1
2167,Samsung,Buen balance entre calidad y precio Pantalla táctil de gran ayuda,5
2168,Samsung,Fast Nice computer,4
2169,Samsung,"Great computer Great computer, but it is not too slimmer but I’m ok with it, the battery life is not too useful",5
2170,Samsung,Excellent option The computer deliver before I specter. At this moment work properly and I'm very happy.,4
2171,Samsung,Good laptop for music production!!! This laptop has def surpassed my expectations. I use it for music production and it is a beast when it comes to processing and memory. Hell even the hard drive is great with a TB of hard drive you can’t go wrong with the price.,5
2172,Samsung,Great computer Great computer,5
2173,Samsung,Amazing Love it !!!,5
2174,Samsung,Did not receive Stylus Great laptop. Took two stars off because I did not receive the stylus as it was advertised!!! False advertising!!!,3
2175,Samsung,La recomiendo Muy buena,5
2176,Samsung,excelente excelente,5
2177,Samsung,Never can login Every time I try to log in it tells me that my password is incorrect and I have to re-enter a password every single time that I try to log into my Chromebook makes it very frustrating it makes it so I don't want to use it,3
2178,Samsung,Great product. Great easy product. Would recommend to anyone.,5
2179,Samsung,Rapida Touch screen,5
2180,Samsung,"I hate Windows so this suits me fine. Love the ease of operation since I am retired and only do stuff like check emails, go online to order/pay bills, watch Vimeo, Zoom,print gift certificates and other basic things. I like how I can navigate the screen with touch and I can use two fingers to enlarge any part of the screen. A lot like my Android phone. You will need to download Word and buy a memory card if you are an addict user. In fact if you spend all day and all night on your laptop, get something else.",5
2181,Samsung,Lots of glitches I have to google to figure them out I like it is light weight.,2
2182,Samsung,"Great for artists Sleek design. Battery life has been impressive so far. The touch screen works quite well and makes the track pad almost pointless.The stylus is an awesome addition. I wanted a computer that I could also use for drawing and this is exactly what I wanted. It's like drawing on paper, not choppy and is very responsive.",5
2183,Samsung,So happy. Love my Gallaxy. I love the chrome also. So easy to use with all the little thing I needed for school.,5
2184,Samsung,where is the pencil that was to be included with this order the computer was fine but it did not include the pencil that was to be included with it,1
2185,Samsung,"Light weight and easy! Great for basic use. Simple layout, great display and touch screen. Fast response when loading web pages.",5
2186,Samsung,Perfect for College I love how light and fast the notebook is! I would definitely recommend this laptop to those looking for something lightweight and easy to use.,5
2187,Samsung,"Nice Device, sounds not so good Its useful for at home learning for my scholars.The sound doesn't work well and its not as bright of a screen as we would prefer, and it seems to be a lot cheaper than when i purchased it.Not Good for business in my opinion.",4
2188,Samsung,"Delivered scratched Bought this for my husbands birthday2 months prior, because it was on sale , so did not open and inspect . Scratched on the casing .My mistake since I missed the return window. Honestly it appears refurbished when I purchased a new unit.",2
2189,Samsung,value for money. excellent laptop,4
2190,Samsung,fast chromebook great for writing reports and anything google!,5
2191,Samsung,"Steep learning curve if you presently use Windows This is a good quality machine, I have no gripe about that. The Google operating system though is a real challenge to learn. If you come from the Windows world, be prepared for a LOT of differences. I would not buy a Chromebook again just for that very reason. Navigation is nonsensical to me. If you just want something to browse the web, this is your cheap ticket. If you're using any Microsoft apps, spend the extra money and get a real laptop.",3
2192,Samsung,"Great Performance at a good price Great screen size and great performance is the headline for this Chromebook.This is used mainly for streaming content. At this it exceeds all expectations. It doesn't seem to get overly warm and the battery life has been above average to average, with a larger screen I expected this.This isn't touchscreen and is not a reversible keyboard but screen size was paramount here not tablet ability.It's quick and responsive, I'll admit I'm still a PC user and as such I keep trying to right and left click on the touch pad and that's a no go as it's single button so no copy and paste from the touchpad which is unfortunate for me as I prefer that to key combos. Regardless of this small niggle everything else is good and I'm expecting to get a good few years out of this then repurpose it after that!Having to do again I think I'd opt for touchscreen and a reversible keyboard. But for what this is, it's a great product. The screen is quite thin so be careful!",4
2193,Samsung,Great chromebook for the price This is a great value chromebook.Don't expect everything for $200 but what it does have is fantastic for the cost.Very happy with the purchase.,5
2194,Samsung,Great value for the price Performs as advertised very happy with the purchase,5
2195,Samsung,"Very limited processing Ok for just the absolute basics like email and word processing but awful for anything else. Media playback is crap, interface w/ downloaded apps is janky and crashes frequently. Would have returned but missed my window :(",3
2196,Samsung,"EXCELLENT EXCELLENT experience!I ordered an open box Samsung laptop. It came with all of the original packing, paper work. You could tell the box had been opened ...everything else inside was brand new.Very pleased!Thanks",5
2197,Samsung,Love it Easy to get to know and does the job. I bought this lab top for start of college and I have no complaints.,5
2198,Samsung,"Great Value! I'm happy I didn't go with the YouTube reviews on this laptop. I've had none of the issues they described. It works great, the display is clear and it's faster than I expected. It's not a touchscreen, but I didn't want that for what I use it for. The battery life is long lasting. I took it for over 8 hours and still had life when I plugged it in again at home. The back pack has a built in charging cord too!",5
2199,Samsung,Ordered twice and broken each time 2nd one broken when it arrived,1
2200,Samsung,Love the product The computer is not touchscreen.You might need to mention to who ever pulls the product to be little easier,5
2201,Samsung,Awesome Great computer! Using it for school and also for travel for my business.,5
2202,Samsung,I don’t recommend this seller I bought a computer 3 months ago. After a month I updated it and the computer died. I contacted customer service because was under warranty. The female who emailed me was so rude. I lost my money!!! I wish I find the email so I can posted it.,1
2203,Samsung,"DO NOT BUY Do not buy! This computer has no functionality. All I do is write papers and research the web nothing crazy virus stuff.. and this computer can not handle it. It is always freezing and blacking out. On top of that the if you come from an Apple computer definitely do not do it. Also the keyboard has too many functions that click while your typing, random stuff will be happening then you look up and you third paragraph is missing. 🙄 I just want to type- I don’t need a bunch of gadgets on the keyboard. I can see why they thought it was cool to add on -but it is not.This computer is literally for a child one only needs one window open. I purchased this as a quick buy as my apple is getting old And slows down and amazon prime priced this at $380 and yup you get exactly what you pay for. My 2013 apple works better And faster than this. Save all your documents continually because this computer will freeze for 20-30min and do not take a test or anything timed or you will be sorry. Definitely Would not suggest! Just spend the money for an adequate computer that matches your speed and needs. Lastly, it feels super plastic, which wouldn’t be a bad thing if it actually worked.",2
2204,Samsung,"Perfect I really love this laptop. It's lightweight, easy to use, and the laptop bag that came with it is great.",5
2205,Samsung,Great Touch screen,5
2206,Samsung,Gone bad Memory is too small，,1
2207,Samsung,"Nice chromebook for the price The screen quality is decent, battery so far is good I haven't use it for long periods at the time.Very happy with it, so far.",5
2208,Samsung,Perfect! Amazing chromebook! Super light and sleek design and is perfect for what i need it for.,5
2209,Samsung,Good value I have used this a few times and so far it seems to be very straight forward and easy to set up. I will be using it for school and I’m sure it will work perfectly,5
2210,Samsung,"Solid, ready to use and very simple setup - plug it in. The feel of this laptop is solid yet light. I purchased it to replace my older notebook mainly because my old machine's updating had expired. I also wanted a more ""traditional"" size. The one thing I would like would be a bit smaller an repositioned so my palms don't make my cursor escape. All in all a good looking, very operational computer.",5
2211,Samsung,"Great value for the price Shipping was fast. Starting it up was super easy and it’s really fast. One thing to beware of- if you get MS office, not all of the functions are available on a chrome book! I was really disappointed after purchasing office. You can do the basics, but for example the data validation or pivot table on excel is not available on chrome book.",4
2212,Samsung,Great laptop! Great laptop easy to use charges really fast great buy.,5
2213,Samsung,Good value This isn't a touchscreen.Very easy to set up. Thin and light.,5

2219,Samsung,"Fast Refurbished, works great so far.Fast",5
2220,Samsung,Video was less than should be Video best was not good.It had a foggy overcast to it. The colors and clarity were not good. Also did not like that the extensions that come with it appeared on my Desktop computer on the opening of the web browser and were not able to get rid of them.,3
2221,Samsung,"Refurbished was perfect. Good as brand new Looked perfect when I opened it which was good bc I bought a refurbished one or something like that. Nice large screen.I was planning to buy a tv for my bedroom but I decided to just get a big screen laptop which is fine. I use it on a bed desk and it works great for being lazy and streaming shows. The only thing I find to be kind of weird is the touchpad.I feel like when I use it to click, I have to press the bottom right corner kind of hard but I’ve heard all Samsung are like that idk",5
2222,Samsung,Fair and true to description One thing i am unhappy about is my screen malfunction... After a day use the computer will begin to overheat and the screen begins to flicker subtly as you move it... for 230$ it is a problem...,3
2223,Samsung,"mouse pad issues I love the Chromebooks' larger screen, unfortunately, the touch pad is not very sensitive. Sometimes I have to find a place on the pat that will let me tap.",4
2224,Samsung,Gifted It! They love it!,5
2225,Samsung,"Great price and worth every penny spent on it. Love this Chromebook.It is exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for my work, but also great for watching video.",5
2226,Samsung,"You did not give me a new product I purchased a new laptop and this box and seal was open, and it said it already had a admin and I could not log in and get access to my files.",1
2227,Samsung,Was not a new product! I ordered new! Key is stuck and keys stick It was not new ! Keys got stuck! I got totally screwed on this product,1
2228,Samsung,Its work good and the battery life perfect. Your browser does not support HTML5 video.,5

2230,Samsung,"Junk.Cannot load files, DVID cannot be attached, and plug does not fit.Do not buy. It does not work.The plug they gave me did not even fit into the Chrome notebook.A total absolute ripoff.The worst I have ever experienced.I might have well just burned my money.",1

No scratches or blemishes. Everything is as promised. I would recommend this computer to anyone that needs a rugged outdoor laptop.",5
2240,Samsung,***CONTACT SELLER FOR ADDITIONAL ACCESSORIES BEFORE PURCHASING*** Would of been 5 Stars but made it 4 for something i thought I'd never write in a review the delivery on the product was way to fast lol & communication from seller was non existent also so here is why i saw in the Q&A if you wanted i back lit keyboard (which is a free add on it said) contact you guys after purchase & i did twice actually once right after purchase then the next day i get an alert saying it was shipped with no contact back from you guys so i contacted you again saying i got an alert saying it was shipped already & I'm not sure if you fulfilled my request still nothing back from you guys it arrived to my house in lighting speed (i got it on 12/2/2020 i believe) which would be amazing normally this is an Xmas gift for my girlfriend & i haven't been able to play with the toughbook to make sure everything works as it should & to see what condition it is in being renewed the condition is very impressive close to like new but not quite the laptop itself performs amazing everything works as it should it loads lighting fast & i was using my phone hot spot so that blew me away buuuut the keyboard wasn't lit i don't know if it it needs to be turned on in settings somwere if it is light activity (by that i mean if the lighting is dim it lights up) i don't think this will be a problem but I'm not gonna be the one using it other then that i am very pleased & happy so far,4
2241,Samsung,"Great Rugged Computer in Great Condition I use Panasonic Toughbook's at work so I wanted one for personal use.My computer was in excellent condition with everything working.The 120v charger is aftermarket but it works.

It's a broken hinge, an easy fix that does not call for a complete replacement. After having done research on my device I found out that hinges frequently break on the pixelbook and google has been gaslighting customers instead of addressing this issue.

2267,Google,"Great for elderly parents. I purchased this to replace my parents (in their 80's) whose laptop was due for an upgrade.. It was very slow and had been purchased right before the windows 10 update.They mainly use it for games (you know, classic solitaire, blackjack, poker), youtube, recipes, FB, whatever.It was difficult for them to navigate the computer at times and I'd get a call or have to go to their house, or do a remote session, to show them how to do whatever it was. Often times I found ads blocking their screen or various pop-ups.I'd thought they'd have a harder learning curve with this than they did. Once I connected their google account and downloaded some new games, tweaked the font & resolution size, bookmarked youtube & their sites, they were up and running.It's been like 2 weeks and I haven't gotten one call asking for help.I disabled the password/pin thing upon opening the chromebook, they open it and it's on right away. The screen is a nice size for them, their laptop was 16in and this one fit the bill, size-wise.Color on the screen is nice. While it doesn't fold in half, it does lay flat - but I don't see then using/needing that feature.They don't unplug it, so I can't comment on battery life.My only complaint so far is that the sound - volume could be louder.",5

I was on a shopping website and kept getting glitches. As test I opened my older acer. It wasn't the website glitching. To bad my old acer won't be getting updates.

I chose the option with 16gb RAM and 192gb storage (64gb native and 128gb on a microSD) and I couldn't be happier with how smoothly I was able to get everything personalized and up and running. I could see this being a great cost-friendly computer for college students or kids doing virtual learning, if a Chromebook isn't an option.I've seen people complaining on other listings that their computers appeared to be resale items from Walmart, so I want to add that that doesn't seem to be the case here.

2299,Google,Only One Ram Slot Upgradable on the Ryzen 3 3550u Version and Missing Screws They changed the internal design on the Ryzen 3 3550u version and I didn't know about it. They removed 1 of the ram slots and 1 is now soldered on so both ram sticks can't be upgraded like the Ryzen 3 3200u version. I was under the impression that both slots were upgradable since Acer America replied to 2 customer questions saying that both memory slots are upgradable but they likely were taking about another version that was listed. This led me to spend $70 extra for 2 8gb sticks that I didn't need. Also the battery isn't even screwed in!,1

All edges match perfectly, so it is quite difficult to open! There is no indent to separate the clamshell. Very very weird as an outcome from designers in todays age.==== FYI ====Aspire 5 A515-46-R14K / AMD Ryzen 3 3350U / 4GB / 128GB1) This model has 1 open DDR Ram slot.

2308,Google,"Why? Useless and reviews that lie don't help. So....basically to the review that is 100 BS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS UNLIMITED STORAGE ON GOOGLE. That's out of the way, now..... chrome os doesn't have a lot to offer.This is just a browser. You want power? Or better response? Get a 70$ samsung smart phone. THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH Ms office, windows, or intense applications. This is only to BROWSE. Get it? The storage capacity is irrelevant because it will only store cookies. You can use 15gbs of storage in GOOGLE Drive. 15gbs of Google photos. And use the Google dots. WHILE there would be people who say this is an amazing machine.... I won't be disrespectful.... but you need to learn and read before you buy. Who can use this? A teacher on a ULTRA BUDGET. They can put youtube videos, or create forms and such. Use to load one content on a class and that's it. Belive it or not, a no brand and no name laptop will perform better. This will play a very limited amount of formats. Then reason to purchase would be portability? Like I said before a 60 to 80$ Samsung will work better, faster, it can work with Ms office and other productive apps. The kicker? You need to buy adapters, such as an hdmi adapter/a splitter and for space a micro SD if the phone requires more space. This will run you at the most a total of 100$ including the phone and a nice case. Want to be fancy? Buy a roku or chromecast and Display the phone to the TV or projector at home or school.

2326,Google,Great balanced laptop Funny how the negative reviews are rarely from seasoned Chromebook users. We know how to use Chromebooks to their fullest as we have been using them for 10+ yrs. They are different from Apple or MS. Chromebooks can do a lot. I use mine for business with no problem. Runs all my MS programs just fine. It has its own office suite but also runs 365 just fine. Teams and video calls are just fine. One thing to note is that this laptop is built for efficiency. Meaning that it's runs an efficient Celeron low power CPU. Don't expect lightning fast response when crunching big data. I find it to be very nimble for most tasks and totally acceptable for heavier tasks. Video editing may be a stretch but I've never tried it. I just got my wife this laptop and we literally had it setup in 10min. Pluses: Get the upgraded ips screen. Well worth it. The B&O sound is great partially due to fact the speakers are on both sides of the keyboard. The backlit keyboard is a plus. Big smooth track pad and 11ish hours of battery life. A great buy for around $200.,5
2327,Google,So easy to set up! I'm a real estate agent so I use my lap top all the time!

If you come from the Windows world, be prepared for a LOT of differences. I would not buy a Chromebook again just for that very reason. Navigation is nonsensical to me. If you just want something to browse the web, this is your cheap ticket. If you're using any Microsoft apps, spend the extra money and get a real laptop.",3
2339,Google,"Great Performance at a good price Great screen size and great performance is the headline for this Chromebook.This is used mainly for streaming content. At this it exceeds all expectations. It doesn't seem to get overly warm and the battery life has been above average to average, with a larger screen I expected this.This isn't touchscreen and is not a reversible keyboard but screen size was paramount here not tablet ability.It's quick and responsive, I'll admit I'm still a PC user and as such I keep trying to right and left click on the touch pad and that's a no go as it's single button so no copy and paste from the touchpad which is unfortunate for me as I prefer that to key combos. Regardless of this small niggle everything else is good and I'm expecting to get a good few years out of this then repurpose it after that!Having to do again I think I'd opt for touchscreen and a reversible keyboard.

2386,Google,"After 4 tries finally found the right Chromebook My Acer 14 that I bought in January 2016 finally had an issue with the power port that I didn't chose to resolve although I loved the computer. It introduced me to Chrome OS and was a rugged, inexpensive computer with great battery life. My first replacement was an Acer Spin 713 that was a sleek, rugged Chromebook. I had to return this because of an issue with the sound. When I listened to Spotify, audio would break up and make popping sounds when I was using the browser on a different page. Since I am always listening to music when I work this was a deal breaker. Next I tried a HP Chromebook, 2-in-1, 14C-CA0053DX. Tried to resolve 2 out of the box issues with HP support. Bluetooth randomly disconnecting and 3 finger gesture only working some of the time. Customer support could not resolve these issues and said I would have to send it in for repair. I returned it instead. Now I decided to save some money and go with a basic Acer 14 inch Chromebook. There weren't any issues with the computer but it just didn't have the build quality of my 2016 Acer 14 and so I returned it.Finally I purchased the Asus Chromebook Flip C434and after about a month using this Chromebook have to say I love it! It has great build quality and a beautiful touch screen display. The only fault is that the backlit keyboard is a little weird and I have to turn it off or on depending on the room lighting because it can be difficult to see the characters. A very minor issue for me and the only negative I can find so far. For $419 that I spent on this Chromebook I got a lot.",5
2387,Google,"My 2nd Chromebook. Will be my last ASUS; dim screen, hard to open unit, misleading accid protection This is my second Chromebook, the first one being a $400 Toshiba that died after five years. I chose this one because of the touchscreen feature and because of the flexibility of the hinge to articulate to make it more of a notepad. It's a well-made unit with less plastic than the old Toshiba and uses metal for the chassis. I mostly use it to surf the web, and it does just fine with that. Battery life is decent.I really dislike how dim the screen is, much dimmer than my new MacBook Pro which has plenty of margin such that I never use maximum brightness. Also, opening the thing up has proven to be a challenge; if it's sitting closed on a desk, it's extremely difficult to pry it open because the horizontal slot upfront has not been machined well enough to allow decent purchase with averaged size fingers. Instead, you have to flip it up on the hinge and then pry it open. Kind of annoying.The reports about the lighted kids being hard to see during the day are spot on. You can get around the problem by turning off the backlit keyboard, but it means having to turn it back on in dim light. I never had this issue with my $400 Toshiba.Lastly, ASUS promises one year of accidental damage protection (ADP) if you register the unit. That proved to be a 45 minute rabbit hole to go down because, at least on the browser website, this unit's model number simply does not exist. I eventually downloaded the app and scanned in the QR code on the back and was able to register it.Unfortunately, the next day, I received an email notification telling me that, because I purchased this on Amazon, I was not eligible for the factory accidental damage protection.Here's what I was told regarding the status of my protection: ""This product was purchased from an authorized reseller that offers its own selection of trusted, premium warranty coverage. Please contactyour authorized reseller for more information regarding additional coverage.""Really uncool, ASUS. You've lost a customer.",2

The 8gb of ram definitely shows; I get 8gb isn’t a lot, but I was able to run Minecraft on it because of the amount of ram (along with the CPU of course). Speaking of the CPU, I believe it either is comparable to a newer i3 or a base model i5; it’s hard for me to say. The M series CPU is definitely not as widely known as the I series ones. Regardless, I have found no issue with it’s performance! To sum this up, it’s a well-optimized chromebook and will be able to do every school/business related task you throw at it and even some other additional perks! Highly recommend it!",5

I kept thinking that the frequent Chrome updates would fix the issue, but they never did.This is my second Acer Chromebook and I think I'm just done with this particular manufacturer.Yes, they're cheap, but if it takes you minutes for a webpage to load when it takes seconds on another machine, you're just wasting your valuable time.",2
2395,Google,Good purchase I bought this Chromebook to replace my son's Chromebook from school. He's going to college and needed something to use before I buy his school laptop. I'm happy with my purchase. It's really like my phone in laptop form. I'll probably use once my son leaves for school.,5

My Chromebook disconnects from my wireless printer at least once a month, and takes hours to reconnect; it's very non-intuitive when I'm trying to pull documents from my external drive; I (and this is my fault, but still a consideration) can't seem to master the differences between ""my drive"" and ""cloud storage"", so finding documents is always a challenge. And I find it nearly impossible to organize my many documents in an intuitive, usable way that I always could with any PC. Bottom line, I've been using the Microsoft O/S since they started and the Google O/S is just too many new tricks for this old dog. I'm buying a new PC today and tossing my Chromebook in the trash where it belongs.",1

2435,Fujitsu,"An amazing tablet at an amazing price I have to say that I read the reviews and i was worried about the quality of the product.After digging into the product and researching reviews outside of Amazon I came with the opinion that the reviews here are underrepresented.Which basically means there are not enough to make a decision.I was pleasantly surprised with this tablet.For me the fact that is came with a keyboard and the reasonable price sold me.Well several months later I'm still very satisfied.I'm a IT pro with 20 years professional experience.I'm going to give some details I love and I'll also provide the cons.Pros:8GB RAM - Memory is enough for what I needed it.Not easy to find an affordable tablet with this much memory.It ensures that I will get the performance I need.Since I've owned it I've not had any performance issues.It's because of the 8GB and it's combined with a decent speed processor.Intel 1.4ghz mobile processor - This combined with the 8gb has provided the performance i'd expect.Very happy with the performance.For me the memory & CPU combo is the most important hardware of what I was looking for because the usual tablets are designed for noobies, and children.This is a business class combo.Keyboard - Usually these devices are hit and miss.It was built high quality both keyboard and mouse touch pad work perfectly after heavy useBattery - A lot of people dont take advantage of windows 10's battery handling settings.Usually because they dont understand it.With some tweaking I've got 5-6 hours off AC.This is excellent and something I'd expect from a full size laptop battery.This will very for people because there is a lot of factors involved in determining how long a battery will last.Some of those are1. Screen brightness 2. Use time 3. How you handle off use time on battery (screen savers, sleep, etc)Adjusting power settings is very important.Wifi - This device has the wifi antenna of a full size laptop.I have a larger home and I brought this tablet everywhere and never had a performance problem.My entire house was covered and so was outside near my house.I also had this baby tethered to my phone as a hotspot outside the home and worked perfectly.Camera - I've not used it yet but the fact it has one is helpful because of covid I'm doing a ton of tele conferencing .Just havent had a chance to use it on my table only my laptop.USB ports, audio port - fully tested worked excellentWindows 10 - I would not have bought this had it used anything but Windows 10 pro.It is far far better for business class use then any other OS software.I can also dual boot this tablet had I wanted to use Linux but I dont have a need to at this point.This tablet has worked flawlessly with Win 10.CONS:4G/Micro SD port - I'm not sure what they sent me here with this.There was something jammed into this port.After I inspected it someone clearly jammed something in there and I was worried if I extracted it with force I was going to damage the port.This was not a deal breaker for me because I can simply use my wifi tethering/hotspot.I was disappointed because I did want to use the SD port with my pile of SD cards.I know of an excellent company that will remove it for me.I should never have to pay someone to do something because a company fails to inspect what they sent out.I should send them the bill for this.Stylus - Well it was said in more then one review this was an issue.So I was prepared for it.They are correct that this was a cheap junk replacement for the high quality one that comes with this tablet.I expected this as I said but they do sell the one that comes with this on Amazon.~$50.The company selling this went cheap here but they could have also sold this with no stylus.I can confirm what they sent works perfectly but it doesnt fit in the tablet and you have to carry it around like a mouse.Pretty lame if you ask me.I'd have been happy to have paid a little more for this had it had that high quality stylus.For me this was not a deal breaker either.I use it mostly when on a site where I dont bring the keyboard and I'm in portable mode.If I really want to upgrade I can.The seller - Though they sold me almost what I expected, they were hard to contact (had to go through amazon support) and their only response was to send it backand they were sorry.I was not willing to send it back without them sending me a replacement first so I can transfer what I put on here.I could offload it manually but why should I do extra work.They never responded after that.The good thing is this is bought with amazon and had I not been sanctified I'm confident amazon would have handled it appropriately in getting my money back had I wanted to return it.To wrap up this review I'd just say I'm extremely happy with this device.I wanted to leave an honest review.One that provided the detail I didnt see in the amazon reviews for then when I bought it.Even taking the cons in to account I still give this tablet a top rating because it was exactly what I was looking for and handles like an expensive tablet like a MS Surface at a very affordable price.I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5
2436,Fujitsu,"WORKED ONLY 120 DAYS I bought this model and it worked very well for the first 120 days. I used it for an hour or two hours a day. I have other Fujitsu computers that still working for many years and some are reconditioned. This model has a lot of good features and has new software. However, the keyboard keys started to stop working; so I did all the software updates that might fix the problem; it did not fix any key. I took the advice of a friend (a computer engineer) who checked it out and said: its a hardware problem; you need a new keyboard; I contacted the seller who was sorry and advice me to go to the manufacture since its over 90 days. So, if you want to buy a computer for $300 and just work 120 days; go for it; otherwise, do not waste your money and go for something else that will last for more than 120 days.",1
2437,Fujitsu,"Great price for such a powerful unit Great screen viewing. Keyboard feels nice. Got this because it has Windows 10 Pro. Came from Win 7. Was concerned about learning how to use the new 10, but found out that it is very intuitive. Especially like talking into mic to start anything Windows. Booting time is lightning fast. Price was why I purchased it. Recommend this to all. This will replace my desktop. Also bought dock port, BT keyboard and mouse and USB Kangaru DVD/CD writer",5
2438,Fujitsu,"Great deal on a great tablet, except... This tablet is fantastic. It runs faster than I ever would have expected. It feels nice to carry and The battery life is actually pretty good in real-life tests. I ran Hulu and firefox for about 4 1/2 hours before I had to recharge. And it recharged really fast, too. The touch screen is wonderfully responsive and has good clarity. The speakers are good enough for movies, but I'd advise headphones for anything with a lot of explosions. The claim of looking and running like new is... about 90% true, actually. The only cosmetic defects are a few nicks too small to photograph and a small bright spot on the screen. None of these are an issue for me. It does run like new. Actually, it holds up remarkably well for a tablet introduced in 2016. So why only 3 stars? One reason. The stylus. I spent a month deciding between multiple choices for a new portable computer. I chose the Q665 for two reasons. 1: Price point vs. features, and 2: a stylus WITH A HOME! I was so excited to find a good stylus with a slot to live in! I've spent more money replacing lost ones than I care to think about. And so when I opened the box I was very, very disappointed to discover that I had been sent a generic stylus that DOES NOT FIT in the assigned slot. So... The ""like new"" claim is closer to 85%, I suppose. For a renewed product of this quality I would expect the right stylus or at the very least a clear statement that it may be a generic one. In conclusion: Wonderful tablet, excellent job on the renewing process, extremely poor choice of KEY accessory.",3

Now, I don't know what it was like a year before without all those patches and updates but boy, the Surface Duo is a half-priced product but definitely not half-a**ed, It's true that there's a myth when you used a dual screen device, you cannot go back to a single screen, but in my opinion it's not only that, this device has 2 perfect ratio screens for documents viewing and drawing, you can have spotify on one and browser on the other, or watching the Olympics on one and fight you way up the Olympus in Titan Quest on the other, the possibilities are endless.This device cannot be compared, there aren't any other device that are like it, the Fold is, well a phone that could fold in half with an easily scratched plastic screen, use case wise it cannot do half the stuff that Duo can do. Yes the specs are yesteryear but it's well enough to handle the job, you're buying the form factor basically, not the specs here.I'm enjoying the device and I would upgrade to the second/third gen. definitely when its time. It's simply awesome.",5
2472,Fujitsu,"Screen Damaged After Opening Box I found the right screen (One with camera) was damaged just above the USB-C port after unboxing this. I believe that something had gotten lodged between the cradle holding the phone & the box itself. This created stress & what looks like a hole right where the screen cracked. After searching the box, I didn't find any object that may have caused this.Unfortunately, I wasn't able to open this until about 40 days after I received it, my wife and I were on vacation when I purchased it and I was expecting to come home to something nice after our trip. The Amazon A-Z guarantee only covers 30 days. This seller and Amazon were completely inflexible in the returns process. The seller had told Amazon that we had dropped the phone, this was relayed through a message an Amazon customer support rep forwarded to us. We are now in the hands of Microsoft's repair, which require $650 for a device replacement, almost what I paid for this in the first place.I understand their stance, and realize I should've checked on this device before the 30 days were up. But I'm kind of floored by how inflexible all parties involved have been.A word of caution about these Surface Duo phones. I have read from many sources that these screens crack VERY easily. If this were to happen to you, Microsoft doesn't have many options for repair, and replacement parts are next to impossible to source (If I could just find the glass for the screen, this wouldn't be as bad an issue for me as I'm confident I can fix this myself).I've been using it for a few days now, after applying a screen protector to the broken glass so I don't cut my finger or make the damage any worse. I enjoy the dual screen/dual app setup. I've been playing some emulators on it and can say that DS using Drastic & 3DS using Citra give a great experience, pretty native to using a DS/3DS. I like playing Killer Sudoku with the calculator open on the other screen. And reading emails with a webpage open on the other screen.I can definitely say however, the software is as buggy as anyone here says it is. There are elements designed by Microsoft that seem to constantly interfere with elements designed by Android.Had this shipped without a cracked screen, I'd likely give it 1, maybe 2 more stars. But I have to get on Microsoft for shipping a device with this issue, and not accepting responsibility for this when questioned about it. The lack of overall customer support regarding this device doesn't give me a lot of hope that it will continue to be supported in the future (This includes updates to Android 11 & 12 in the future).",2

2474,Fujitsu,"Best Smartphone I've Had So Far *Value*: Excellent value for money. I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my wife. I bought on Amazon USA and had them delivered to my home in the UK. The combined cost of the two devices, shipping and taxes still cost me less than a folding flagship phone from other manufacturers.*Quality*: Excellent quality product. I can't believe how thin an light it is. The screen is nice and large, even when folded. When folded, it's still as thin as my soon to be sold Samsung Galay Note.I can tell they are constantly improving the device because when I was setting it up, it took a long time installing several updates.My wife tends to only use the basic features on phones but she quickly got the hang of this because it's so intuitive.*Use*: The camera quality is fairly okay. The productivity I achieve from having 2 screens is out of this world.I can be on a Zoom call on one screen while looking at the book I'm discussing on the other screen.For work, I can be on an MS Teams video call while reviewing and editing a document on the other.I can be searching for products on Amazon while watching the review videos on Youtube on the other screen.I can have the baby monitor video feed on one screen and chatting on Whatsapp on the other.I can have my banking app open on one screen and my budget open in Excel on the other.My child can be watching a video on one screen while I read an article on the other screen.Truly amazing! All of this on 2 screens that are large, full featured and responsive.*Pros*: Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note, I find that using the Surface Pen on this does 95% of what the S-pen can do which is good enough for me.Handwriting recognition with the Gboard keyboard is just the same as the Samsung Galaxy Note. This whole review is written with that.So thin and light!! Easily fits in my pocket.Excellent battery life.Screen quality is excellent.I don't need a phone holder at the table anymore.*Cons*: No NFC. Camera quality is only okay. Once they get compressed by social media apps or Google photos as these apps do with all photos, I barely notice the difference from my previous phone. The camera shutter speed has a bit of a delay.Not water and dust resistant.The gap at the hinge, stops it just short of being a tablet replacement for large screen image and video consumption.*Verdict*: I have owned PDAs, smartphones, tablets and touchscreen laptops running Windows, iOS, Android, Symbian and Linux since 2000 and this is an amazing product that combines the best features of all of them. It's not perfect, but it's the best so far.",5
2475,Fujitsu,I love this Surface for around a month! Phone use is low as this is my second line phone.Love everything about it. Its not a quick work phone but will be with version 2. Its a awesome value right now. You are basically getting two devices for one price.There are some apps that should be disabled and removed. I can go 2-3 days some evening browsing / use on a single charge. Not bad at all considering the alternatives on a small and skinny single screen!,5
2476,Fujitsu,Works perfect as a tablet Works perfect as a tabletPhone use not so good and picture use not so good,5
2477,Fujitsu,"A dented cardboard box containing a high-priced product. For the first time, I tried to buy from US Amazon from Japan.I used the account I created before and the credit card payment went smoothly.The evaluation of the product itself was as expected, as I had checked online and by word of mouth.As a result, I was not able to confirm any abnormalities or damage, which is good. However, as a Japanese, I cannot understand the sense of shipping the product all the way across the ocean from the US, only putting it in a large box without any cushioning material.I don't need excessive packing, but I would have liked to see at least some cushioning material to prevent the product from moving in the box.The product is an expensive precision electronic device.",4
2478,Fujitsu,"Wanted to love it. But I could not It is a great concept, the hinge is magical, love how it sounds puffff when it folds shut, extremely well built, not too heavy for its size, premium materials, screens are bright and vivid.However, it won't do well as a daily because of the form factor and the software bugs. Too large for holding one handed and to put in a jeans pocket, camera quality just isn't there and the software is full of little glitches, lack of essential features. For example, no double tap to wake, making it not ideal for note taking (which is one of its selling point) with a pen because I would need to press unlock it every few minutes.Many good things about it makes me really want to keep it as a second device but then, an iPad mini would do all it does as a second device at under 400. Sad.",3
2479,Fujitsu,"Great Device At first I was a little skeptical, because of the android part of the device, but the more I play with it the more I like it, I was able to download books from different sources and that’s the main reason why I bought this device.",5
2480,Fujitsu,Bad experience The computer crashed and blue screen multiple times and although I was able to restore to factory settings it crashed again and I had to return 2 weeks later after the purchase.,1
2481,Fujitsu,"the speed i just bought this laptop one thing i notice is that the volume is very low, but the laptop is very fast, the letters on the key boards, very visible have enough space for anything, operates well with your TV. NOT REALLY AS LIGHT WEIGHT AS I THOUGHT, VERY BRIGHT",4
2482,Fujitsu,"First impression for its size and weight is great Looking for a loaded laptop with few upgrades needed. Found that in the Vastking Kingbook. I very much like the capabilities and the power seems to match the performance. Running a few programs and comparing speeds, this laptop seems to hold it's own. Not mentioned much is the pure conveienene of the laptop. Very thin and the weight is lighter than you'd expect. I plan on using this laptop a lot and looking forward to many years of service. I like that it comes with a one year standard warranty. Gives piece of mind.",5
2483,Fujitsu,"Tiny I have given it to my girlfriend and have been using it for a week. It is small in size and she likes it very much!Not only is the appearance cute, but its numeric keyboard is very attentive, and the system operates smoothly.Congratulations, I bought the right gift!",5

2485,Fujitsu,"Great ! The laptop is great but the description is confusing. I am not disappointed with the laptop. It runs great but the confusion is where it states ""(renewed)(new)"" which one is it. Renewed or new ?It came to be ""certified refurbished"" thats the only issue I have. But hobestly, other than the stickers that look warn a bit, you'd never know it wasn't brand new. And no I am not getting paid to say this. Lol.",5
2486,Fujitsu,All is good Is used. but for the price is good.,5

2489,Fujitsu,"Fast, compact, and an all around great computer Extremely happy with my purchase. This computer is fast and efficient. I especially like the back lit keyboard and (i know this may sound odd) the texture of the case. It's non-slippery so you can keep a good grip on it while carrying. I do wish it had a 10 key... But oh well. You gain some you lose some. Great computer though. It boots up in less then 30 seconds (a far cry from the 8 minutes it took my lenovo!)Love it.",5
2490,Fujitsu,"Bateria Mala La laptop es buenisima en rendimiento, pero la bateria me salio mala a los 15 min se apaga.",2
2491,Fujitsu,Great laptop all around Laptop arrived ahead of estimated delivery.Laptop looks and works great!,5
2492,Fujitsu,"It seem falling apart I like dell product but this refurbished one seem falling apart, I rarely use, I bought for reserved for other dell laptop but this one has the screen turn off sometimes ,I have to push it back and forth to make It back on. It scared me, so I have to connect via HDMI to see when I work. I do not expect the garbage refurbished.",2
2493,Fujitsu,"I Love This Tablet Received laptop today. Although it came in a brown-generic Amazon cardboard box, the laptop looks like new. I comes with the power supply and a little documentation with some useful information, like how to use the recovery media from the drive partition and how to reinstall the OS.One the first thing I did and suggest everyone do is to check for drivers’ updates. Most of the drivers installed went back to when the laptop was manufactured. Dell makes checking your driver simple and painless...just go to Dell Support and follow driver update instructions. Its application found eight new (2018) drivers, including a BIOS update.Once all drivers were installed I ran the OS CleanUp application; it only found 316MB of data to delete. Didn’t run the Defrag application since it’s not require on an SSD. Using Cortana I checked for updates and received the following: Your device is at risk because it's out of date and missing important security and quality updates. Let's get you back on track so Windows can run more securely. Select this button to get going: “I clicked the Check for Updates button. It took quite sometime, but the updates were download and installed”.I then created a new hard drive partition using Windows 10 Disk Management application.Creating a new partition allows the saving of all documents, music files and so forth separate from where the OS is installed. Creating a new partition on an existing hard drive using Windows 10 is not difficult; if in doubt search the web.Anyway, the PC runs just like new and better than my old Alien laptop. Connection to the internet is much faster as well. I have fiber optic internet provided by ATT and the speed it’s supposed to be over 100 Mbps. I really never got over 50 Mbps when using my Alien laptop, but are getting over 120 Mbps when using this laptop, same as my PC which is wire connected. The backlit keyboard is a plus. It isn't loaded with useless software either.All in all, this an excellent laptop at a good price and I recommend it.3/3/2018: I failed to add that the laptop comes with just a few programs installed: VLC media player which is open-source media player; LibreOffice, which is similar to Microsoft Office; and Mozilla FireFox browser.",5
2494,Fujitsu,100/10 I use this thing everyday it’s great for people of all ages it’s my favorite laptop I’ve ever owned,5
2495,Fujitsu,Love it! I use the laptop for school mainly and I have no complaints at all. I take really good care of the laptop and it’s still working the exact same as it did fresh out the box 5 months later.,5

2504,Fujitsu,"Compatible with Windows 11 and BitLocker We were looking for a cheap tablet for using in a shop environment to view PDF files while working on equipment.We wanted to use Windows and we wanted it to be compatible with Windows 11 so we don't have to buy something new in four years.This little tablet hit all the marks and we can attach a keyboard on top of it.It has a TPM chip, you can enable BitLocker, the Windows 11 compatibility checker passes and confirms it is compatible with Windows 11.It has a USB C Charging port.It's a pretty amazing little tablet. The next cheapest we could find was the Microsoft Surface Go with 8GB RAM for around $550.00 and we can buy two of these for that! Now we just have to see if it lasts until Windows 11 comes out :).",5
2505,Fujitsu,"Does not ship with a licensed copy of Windows While the quality of the tablet appeared to be good. It does NOT ship with a licensed copy of Windows.After dealing with a less then professional support process, I decided to return the tablet.BUYER BEWARE!!!!",1
2506,Fujitsu,"Very powerful for a tablet but some FYI's you might want to know I am very satisfied with this tablet. Great for travel on business.Only drawback is hypersensitive keyboard.The cursorgoes all over the screen when trying to type with keyboard. Not sure if it's just my unit or all in production.Also, this works fine with driving a projector bur only from its micro HDMI to normal HDMI on a projector. The projector never could get a signal with the other connections ports.Also, most of the advertisements on these mobile projectors say they are not recommended for Power Point Presentations.I don't know why these say that. Mine works fine with PPT.",4
2507,Fujitsu,"On this item Windows 10 would not activate In all honesty this was the perfect tablet show ever it had o roge copy of windows 10 because I couldn't get it to activate. After contacting the company they sent two links one of which was written in Chinese but the link to activate still did not work, you would think if you pa $200.00 for any electronic you wouldn't have such a problem even if you are tech savvy it's not your job to fix it.",1
2508,Fujitsu,"Problems using as a Windows 10 device My husband bought this and when things were not working as expected, he tried to contact the vendor as the documentation was about 2 pages, half in Chinese, and documentation covered things like ""don't drop it"".He ended up returning it, so we don't know what the problem was.He is fairly experienced with Windows 10 but this, although it seemed to be nicely built, didn't work as expected",1
2509,Fujitsu,I love this tablet I love this tablet!,5
2510,Fujitsu,"Just walk away Loved it for eight days until it died. Now the only way to get the screen to work is by holding down the power button the whole time you're typing or doing whatever. Let go of the button and the screen instantly dies, impervious to any other intervention. And then it's a half dozen times to get it back up, as even the power button trick isn't 100%. Totally unusable like this. Also took multiple exchanges to get an accurate Windows product key, so actual days of use was about four.",1
2511,Fujitsu,"False advertising waste of money!They sent me an illegal copy of Windows 10. Illegal unlicensed Microsoft windows 10.Be warned this did not come with Windows 10 you have to pay Microsoft separately for it.Does not ship with Microsoft certificate of authenticity or product code key, and their customer service is useless.They lied told me the problem was taken care of with Microsoft try to register again, still does not work.Don't waste your money and if you have the same problem help me make Amazon drop them as a seller.For what it's worth the hardware is excellent, top shelf for the money, but useless without the advertised software.",1

2519,Fujitsu,"Great product for remote classes I bought this laptop for my 3rd grade daughter to continue her remote classes in summer vacation. We compared several low-end products and chose this product. Overall, the laptop worked very well for our purpose and totally worth the price. The laptop is not heavy and the battery lasts long. The 14-inch monitor provided clear and vivid display for class material – with fonts sufficiently big for kid. The hardware is effective for internet browsing, video streaming, Microsoft Office 365, Acrobat Reader as well as basic kid programming (like scratch and python). The advantage to have an operation system (Win10) is easiness to install software – which is sometimes not very straightforward in a Chromebook. When in use, this laptop generates little heat, has no fan and therefore is pretty quiet, which is good for kid’s focus.On the other hand, the hardware can be easily configured and loaded (i.e. with background monitoring software) so that the laptop cannot efficiently handle computer games – which is BRILLIANT – so that the kid can forget about computer games.",5
2520,Fujitsu,"Excellent Computer Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This computer is an excellent one. The material that is used to build this computer is solid.

2523,Fujitsu,"Enough for daily use Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I use this computer mainly to browse the web and watch youtube videos. Compared with my gaming computer, it is light, has no fan, and also with very low heat and long battery life.It is enough for daily applications such as youtube videos and web pages.Although Celeron processors cannot be compared with processors such as i7 and i5, they are sufficient for daily applications. In addition, I am satisfied with the 14-inch IPS monitor and audio system.",5
2524,Fujitsu,"Intel makes your life stronger The cost of choosing different laptop models ranges from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars. The key is to pay attention to the value it brings to you. Therefore, I choose a laptop with Intel processor, which can bring you the most value in terms of performance and portability. Moreover, memory provides a new method of memory and storage, which can boot and start applications quickly, smoothly and easily. It can provide all-weather battery life, and it is light and portable. It can be said,When using the new Windows 10 processor, it will be more efficient and creative, and the effect will be even more amazing. It will not only bring you the powerful functions and performance you need, but also enable you to achieve more goals and run better.",5

Unfortunately these devices cannot be serviced locally. You must mail them in to LG and pay $500 upfront for servicing. I don't care to have to replace a laptop every year!!

The weight is tiny but it feels rock solid.The ONLY thing I can ding this for (but will not) is it not remembering keyboard lighting mode between sleeps (in linux). The keys are white and lit white and when the screen and other screens cast light on the keyboard when backlit, the keys disappear.I turn off backlighting and it is perfect but after a sleep back to full on. If that is my biggest gripe, not bad and this thing makes me happy about laptops again. Well done LG.Update 6/24/21: Still love it. Almost went crazy on Amazon day to buy it's big brother. Should have. This laptop is still the best I ever owned and I toss 2-3 a year after beating the SSDs with a sledge. Not this one. Still love the white and the trim.

The display colors are a bit odd even after adjustments, the black is not really black and white is not really white. otherwise pretty good laptop.Since my Zenbook was already ultra light (around 2.6lb) I didn't notice much difference withLGh16, except it's being slightly lighter considering how massive laptop is, so kudos for LG.IMO LG killed it. An anti-reflecting screen & maybe better display colors would make this machine perfect.",5
2573,LG,"Great light notebook. Bought this for my wife. She likes it. Very for the size. Easy set-up; no real bloat ware. Seems very snappy. Screen is very nice. Keyboard is fine.Only con is that sound could be a little stronger/louder, but easy to link to a Bluetooth speaker.",5
2574,LG,"The older LG gram 15.6 was better The build quality is very nice, it’s fast, and the keyboard/track pad is very nice. But…. The shape is weird (taller than usual which leads to a longer keyboard area, it’s just different), the screen is NOT touchscreen, the monitor is extremely glossy so it’s not easy to see clearly if there is any brightness or lights near you. And lastly and most annoyingly, this laptop gets unbearably hot if you are charging it while using it. I came from the LG 15.6 which never got hot even after 2-3 years of every day use. This laptop is agitating my fingers from heat since day 1. If you’re not charging it’s fine, but don’t expect to use it comfortably if you are charging.",3
2575,LG,"Great laptop, highly recommend! Fabulous laptop! So light and so responsive!The screen feels huge for the size of the laptop. Absolutely LOVE IT!",5
2576,LG,"Loving it! It is so light, akin to holding a magazine.It is slimmer and narrower than my Dell Inspiron 15, yet the screen is bigger.Just had it two days, but so far the processor seems quick and the display clear and bright.Very happy with my purchase.",5
2577,LG,"A large screen size and very little weight with plenty of power I am doing this review from the LG Gram 16 notebook, it has very good performance.Big screen, light weight and with advantages such as a lot of ram -16 Gb-, one Tb of solid state disk and a i7-1165G7 11th gen (@ 2.80GHz), intel evo. It comes with some pre-installed software, and windows 10 home, all customizable.Finally it's indicated that I arrive in my country without problems in less than a week!, a very good purchase, to recommend",5
2578,LG,"Updates and I use (or try to use) this laptop for both personal and work related tasks, but it comes up extremely short in serving both categories. Besides constantly updating (which I know occurs with most laptops nowadays), both it's physical and digital interface are a bit clunky- I constantly have to navigate around pop up messages (no matter how many times I reset notifications) regarding updates and buying products. I also repeatedly have issues uploading and saving projects with this laptop. This was recommended to me for it's versatility and long lasting battery, but only have found the latter to be true. Do yourself a favor and find another laptop.",2
2579,LG,"Almost excellent laptop. Been playing around with the 16 inch version for several weeks now. build-wise I am very pleased. The screen doesn't wobble too much and the keyboard is just lovely to use. I will say there's one potential issue, where if you put enough weight/pressure on the space left or right of the touch pad, you can get it to register as a click, but in practical use it never happened. Something to watch out for if you have massive sausage arms that lay flat on the laptop, maybe. That aside, I REALLY like the trackpad. It's been like a decade since I used a laptop pad so I was assuming a mouse would be a mandatory purchase, but not anymore. The multi-touch controls work great, and it's nice and big so I never feel like my fingers are gravitating too far into a corner to browse properly.On the software side of things I am impressed with the SSD and operating system. Once you got your user settings entered the first time around, the computer can go from the powered-off state to your home screen in like fifteen seconds. I haven't extensively tested the CPU, though I've found it can run Overwatch at low settings and 60fps with only minimal tinkering.I primarily use it for writing and the occasional google research/time waster, which it handles with ease, and I'm sure it could stream a Spotify setlise or play iTunes on top of that as well. It also didn't seem like a big deal at first, but the fingerprint scanner is so nifty to have, I have actually become spoiled on it and feel irritated when I have to type my password out on the desktop.There are some ""bloatware"" applications pre-installed that you could do without, such as McCaffee, but mostly the applications seem fine. There's the LG Virtoo app that can sync to an LG phone, which I also happen to have. Testing it...I mean, it works, you can send/receive calls through the laptop and copy over any photos you've taken, but the bluetooth connectivity would kill your phone battery with any extensive use, and the sound/mic quality on the Gram is not professional by any means. Far more useful is the simple control panel that has your power features, screen brightness and fan options at just a click away. There's also an LG-branded video editor, though given the Gram's low voltage and integrated graphics, I doubt you'd want to compile any 4k footage on this laptop.There's only a handful of nitpicks bring it down to a 4/5. Main thing is, for whatever reason, I can't get it to save separate power usage/brightness settings depending on whether it's plugged in or not. This is quickly fixed by clicking the battery on the taskbar and using the hotkeys to change the screen's brightness, but it is irksome to do it EVERY single time. Secondly, if you use the Gram at a less than full charge while charging, the charger brick gets surprisingly warm. I'd say it's hot, even. Lastly, the screen is really glossy. As a cave-dwelling hermit this doesn't affect me, but I can imagine using this in an outdoor setting or coffee shop with a bunch of overhead lamps might not be the best experience.Can I recommend this absurdly expensive laptop to everyone? Well, no. It fits my niche of needing a super lightweight quiet writing device with a decent screen size, easily capable of some research googles or wasting time with very light gaming sessions. In this regard I am super satisfied. If you need something for gaming, media production or media consumption, there are cheaper, better options available.",4
2580,LG,Amazing screen resolution Perfect laptop if you use your laptop to watch movies. Unbelievable light weight. Really beautiful.,5
2581,LG,Love it Easy to get to know and does the job. I bought this lab top for start of college and I have no complaints.,5
2582,LG,"Great Value! I'm happy I didn't go with the YouTube reviews on this laptop. I've had none of the issues they described. It works great, the display is clear and it's faster than I expected. It's not a touchscreen, but I didn't want that for what I use it for. The battery life is long lasting. I took it for over 8 hours and still had life when I plugged it in again at home. The back pack has a built in charging cord too!",5
2583,LG,Ordered twice and broken each time 2nd one broken when it arrived,1
2584,LG,Love the product The computer is not touchscreen.You might need to mention to who ever pulls the product to be little easier,5
2585,LG,Awesome Great computer! Using it for school and also for travel for my business.,5
2586,LG,I don’t recommend this seller I bought a computer 3 months ago. After a month I updated it and the computer died. I contacted customer service because was under warranty. The female who emailed me was so rude. I lost my money!!! I wish I find the email so I can posted it.,1
2587,LG,"DO NOT BUY Do not buy! This computer has no functionality. All I do is write papers and research the web nothing crazy virus stuff.. and this computer can not handle it. It is always freezing and blacking out. On top of that the if you come from an Apple computer definitely do not do it. Also the keyboard has too many functions that click while your typing, random stuff will be happening then you look up and you third paragraph is missing. 🙄 I just want to type- I don’t need a bunch of gadgets on the keyboard. I can see why they thought it was cool to add on -but it is not.This computer is literally for a child one only needs one window open. I purchased this as a quick buy as my apple is getting old And slows down and amazon prime priced this at $380 and yup you get exactly what you pay for. My 2013 apple works better And faster than this. Save all your documents continually because this computer will freeze for 20-30min and do not take a test or anything timed or you will be sorry. Definitely Would not suggest! Just spend the money for an adequate computer that matches your speed and needs. Lastly, it feels super plastic, which wouldn’t be a bad thing if it actually worked.",2
2588,LG,"Perfect I really love this laptop. It's lightweight, easy to use, and the laptop bag that came with it is great.",5

Just Good GOING TO KEEP THIS SHORT AND SWEET.-Beautiful large 16:10 screen-keyboard is awesome, touchpad is awesome-processor speed and graphics are all amazingCONS THAT REALLY IRRITATE ME-This laptop is unbelievably hot doing even the most minimal tasks-nowhere near 19 hours of battery life-cannot get in touch with customer service or support to figure out this heat issue-screen is just mediocrely brightOverall-this laptop has all the top specs for 2021. The laptop does seem to have some issues. Maybe this is my laptop only. But I cannot put it on my lap. Gets up to 90°C. I need to plug it in because it dies pretty quickly… Definitely not 19 hours. This should be about a $1200 laptop MAX. I am just decently satisfied with my purchase. Wish I did not spend $1700 on it.AND WHY IS IT SO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH CUSTOMER SUPPORT",4
2592,LG,Blue Screen I got blue screens so many times. I reset windows many times. But still same.... I should have bought surface not gram....,1
2593,LG,Light as a feather This is a top rated laptop in Consumer Reports.It is astonishingly light weight.Supposed to have a good battery life.I've not tested that yet.It doesn't have a touch screen which is an adjustment but not a problem.So far so good.,5
2594,LG,"Incredible machine - no complaints It's been basically the perfect computer.Super light weight, huge screen, number pad, USB-C and A ports, full size HDMI, Thunderbolt for use with USB-C monitors.. I also like the feature where you can set it to charge only to 80% in order to prolong the lifespan of the battery.The only changes I'd make would be a matte screen instead of glossy and an option for 32GB of RAM, but neither of those has been an actual issue so far.",5
2595,LG,"I LOVE my LG Gram-17 laptop! This is the second LG Gram-17 laptop that I've purchased and both are extremely good! The LG-Gram 17 is so lightweight that I can pick it up with one hand from where it leans up against my couch. Because of that I often use it without a lap table. I will note, however, that the upgraded Gram-17 is a bit warmer sitting on my lap than the previous model because the 2021 version was redesigned with a heat release at the bottom rear of the unit.Everything about the 2021 model is better than the previous one. The backlit keyboard and touchpad have both been redesigned and improved. The SSD is much faster — I bought mine with a 1TB drive, but a 2TB drive is available for around $100 more. The laptop's hinge has been improved, as well.The LG Gram-17 is now equipped with an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 chip that is AWESOME! On top of that, it is now EVO-rated, which means an improvement over the laptop's already impressive battery life! Note that the Gram-17 doesn't come with a touchscreen and I have read in multiple reviews that it is not the laptop you want to buy if you're a gamer.The screen is beautiful but extremely glossy, so if you're working in a room or office with bright lights, you might consider purchasing a matte screen protector.I'm a newspaper editor and this laptop works great for everything from web browsing and photo editing to working with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. I'm testing the Windows 11 beta and the Gram-17 runs the updated OS flawlessly.I've been a Mac user since the mid-80s and currently own an M1 Mac mini and Macbook Air, along with an Intel 16-inch MacBook Pro. Despite my affection for Macs, I often find myself grabbing the Gram-17 simply because it's such a delight to use. The laptop has never let me down in terms of performance and because of its light weight, it's also my laptop of choice when going on trips. I have no complaints whatsoever. The LG Gram-17 is simply a GREAT laptop!",5

Other people had mentioned it was very good but mine only lasts a couple of hours.The machine itself runs well and quickly. I'm not terribly adept but haven't noticed any bloatware hogging the CPU.

2612,LG,"The laptop is ideal for the tasks for which I bought it I want to say that I do not need a computer to calculate any complex algorithms or install programs that emulate the flight of spaceships. I needed a large and high-quality screen and lightweight device so that my wife could use it as a portable device. I was very pleasantly surprised when I was able to put this 17 '' laptop in a bag that I bought for a 15'' device. The screen size is sufficient to accommodate all the necessary applications without connecting additional screens, the battery is enough for the whole working day; the best part is that now she can work not only from our office but also take this laptop to the pool area and comfortably perform any tasks there.",5

2614,LG,"lightweight powerhouse They aren't kidding when they say this is a lightweight unit, it is. I've had it a week now and so far so good, it's performing well with a few minor dislikes. I'm wondering how the longevity will be, I'm not sure I woulduse this for kids or school if it has to be transported much.The unit does run hot It was touted as 17 hr battery life and I'm finding it closer to 5 which is great but not 17.the sound on this is lacking, I find it hard to watch a movie or video and hear it with any background noise.Overall I'd purchase again but in a 15"" screen just because the flex on these worries me. Other than that it seems to perform well. It is a featherlight hot little powerhouse!",4
2615,LG,"day 1. looking good. a big fan for lg gram series since 2017. It was a different model, 15 inch. Now I got this baby with 17 inch (I program daily), for working remotely. It's an easy comparison, but the screen resolution... gosh, lg display is a top quality for sure... so vivid. functionality is good, but basic ram usage is ~4 GB, so I have to test out if 8GB is enough ( no issues with my old lg gram, but who know). for office work, this is perfect. light but sturdy, large screen laptop. in terms of sturdy body, i have a lot to say, cuz I did lots of ""stress testing"" with my old one, and it's still functional. the light weight certainly is a big plus for that (heavier body is easier to break when fallen).The only concern I have is battery, but I will try it for the next 30 days at least.update (07.06)it's been several weeks since I bought it, and working great with no issue. as sturdy as my previous lg gram. especially appreciate the larger screen; i don't think i can go back to 15 anymore. the weight is very light despite the screen size - so it's a perfect item for programmers like me. the CPU and RAM is probably an average, but I can use cloud for heavy computational work, which is rare at this point. the battery is kinda meh, but certainly one-day work without charge is not an issue, so I am okay with that. 5/5 sastified.",5

Works great with everyday tasks like web browsing, watching YouTube videos, playing DVDs (with separate USB player, does not include a DVD player for obvious reasons). Great all-day battery life, and the keyboard feels nice. The light weight and battery life were the main reasons I bought it, and does not disappoint in those areas. Would work nicely as a primary machine for most people who don't play games or do a lot of video editing, etc. No advanced cooling due to the compact size, but very happy with the purchase.",4
2619,LG,Best choice possible! I love everything about it. Super light! Very long battery. Fastest computer I've owned.,5
2620,LG,"It's hard to use anything else When I buy laptops, I always shop for something light and portable. I've tried many different portable laptops but nothing comes close to LG Gram. I would say the closest competition is Lenovo's ThinkPad X1. Once you get used to LG Gram, it's almost impossible to go back to anything else. LG Gram's are ultra portable, extremely light and quiet. The keyboards are comfortable, screen is crisp and bright and it has one of the best battery life out there. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a laptop they can carry around all day without having to worry about battery life.",5

I wish they had put one of each on each side (egthe power outlet is on my right side, and a USB-A device is left side :(- the display is nice (great colors), but the monitor is glossy... A mirror!

2635,LG,"Feels like it weighs just one ""gram"" First Impression: This thing is LIGHT. No seriously…I thought I received an empty box when I received the package in the mail, that’s how light this thing is.Specs are always a hard thing to consider when reviewing since so many laptops come in so many configurations, but I have the i7-11th gen model, with 16gb of high speed DDR4 RAM, a 512 GB NVMe SSD, and without touch screen. With the SSD and i7, this thing literally boots up in 5 seconds. It’s blazing fast and handles my software development tasks without any issues whatsoever. I don’t envision many people who buy this laptop will be able to push it to it actual limits, with the exception of some gamers possibly.The camera and microphone on this are phenomenal for a laptop and with more people working from home, that was/is important for me. My favorite thing has to be the screen. I feel as though 1080p just isn’t enough. And 4k resolution is overboard on a 13-14” laptop. The resolution on this of 1200p is perfect in my opinion. You get a little more working room, and it keeps everything nice and perfectly sized. Being an IPS panel the colors and lighting are great as well. No edge lighting is visible at all to me. The keyboard is backlit and is a must have now for any laptop in my opinion. My only complaint, and literally the only complaint, is that the keyboard just doesn’t feel…”right”. I think the keys could be a little smoother. I’m hoping that they “settle” in with more use, but currently I feel like they are a bit stiff. I have also been using the same laptop/keyboard since 5 years and probably have just gotten used to it by now and need to accept something new. The trackpad is big which is welcoming so I don’t have to lazily lift my finger up to get from one corner of the screen to the next. The USB-C ports are a must now a days. Carrying one universal cable for everything is a godsend. Beinga laptop, portability and performance should be number one, which this laptop is covering perfectly. Laptop, charger (small footprint too by the way), and one USB-C cable for charging/connecting my mobile devices, along with used to connect to an external monitor as needed.This thing does everything in a super light package and makes traveling fun again. Leaves more weight for souvenirs!",5

2646,LG,"So far so good I was looking a long time for a laptop to replace my 8 year old laptop. My prerequisites were for it to have atleast 32gb ram, 1tb ssd, and touchscreen. I looked for a long time. I finally found it in this laptop. As an added feature, this laptop is extremely light. So whats the catch? It has everything you could want right? It has thunderbolt 4 connectivity, Bluetooth, a number pad, touchscreen, super fast ram, ssd, what else could you want? Well the screen is only 1920x1080 resolution. Thats blu ray quality but not 4k. I think it will output 4K quality to an external screen though. Thats the only con I can think of in this laptop. The Battery is a beast and since its not a 4k screen, the battery should last a long time. I've had this laptop for 3 days and I haven't charged it yet. I was hesitant about this laptop because it is so light and has all the power....I thought the fan might be an issue. Well the fan is not an issue. The laptop doesn't get that hot, and the fan comes on minimally, and when it does it is super quiet.So far I am pleasantly surprised on how fast this laptop is. Loading seriously takes like 2 seconds at the most. I will update in about a month.",5

2651,LG,"Big power, still super portable TL;DR: Love it. SO much power in 2.5 lbs, still great battery life, convenience of a touch screen for the odd times that's useful, all the dang ports. I needed extra oomph over my 4 year old gram, and this packed more punch than expected.Spotted this model on LG's site though it wasn't formally announced even by the time I received it about a week ago. It's exactly as described here, including the 32 GB of RAM which surprised me. Intel Iris Xe graphics, 11th gen i7, 1 TB NVMe SSD. I'm a big fan of the entire line for being so portable. Seriously, if you move around a lot having a lightweight laptop is awesome.This from perspective of a 4-year old LG Gram 13 owner (7th gen i5, 16GB RAM, upgraded SSD). My old one was a dream, working admirably even now, but wanted something with just a bit more oomph for casual online gaming with friends. Wanted all the ports of the 2021 Gram laptop line, but to still have a touch screen for occasional use.It. Is. Awesome.Webcam: Not in the hinge! Though they fixed that years back. White balance is good. Image kinda grainy and not great in low light. It'll do though. Microphone array is remarkable. I used it for a group meeting and clearly picked up everyone in a medium-sized conference room, better than our telecom.Keyboard: Still getting used to the layout. The trackpad is a little to the left of where it is on the new Gram 16, and I like that. I can type without my hand brushing it. Keys are indeed a little more clicky and deeper. I got used to the feather touch of my old Gram, but this is also very good and tactile.Display: Very good. This is 16:9. Still too dang shiny, so usual reflection problems. But crisp, vivid, good brightness. It could stand to be a 1440p display instead of 1080p, but it still looks sharp and lower res means better battery. NOTE this is a laptop style, not a fully foldable 2-in-1. Touchscreen is there though, which I find convenient once in a while, signing things and stuff. Screen surface feels kinda ""sticky"" somehow. Maybe it has some protector on it I can't see. Doesn't quite get as smudgy as my old one though which is nice. Anyway, it's there and that's fine.Body: Key thing for a Gram! Even this Gram 15 has a footprint practically equal to the display size, edge-to-edge, so it's a real efficient size. Still at just 2.5 lbs (the full 2-in-1's are heavier, even the Gram 14 2-in-1).I do miss the balance of my smaller Gram 13, this one being a couple inches wider but almost the same depth. But the 15 has the bonus of a num pad I haven't enjoyed in a long time.Ports: Yooooo! How do more ultraportables not have this many ports?!?! Thank you, LG. It's flippin' great not needing dongles just to use a USB-A or an HDMI projector/display. And to have standard USB-C charging up to 100 W. Neato.Battery: Only had it a week so far, but easily looks like it's still great battery on balanced mode. Got through about 4 hours of work including a 90 minute zoom meeting and only dropped by 38%.Performance: Fantastic. This was the main reason for my upgrade. Buckle up for my unreasonable test...My *old* Gram couldn't quite hack casual gaming while also on video chat, something I did more with friends through the pandemic. The video chat would start flaking out while the game graphics stuttered on the lightest settings and reduced resolution. It's not a fair thing to ask a non-gaming laptop. I stressed this 2021 model on ""performance mode,"" with a widescreen 2560x1080 monitor connected as a second HDMI display. Video chat on the laptop display, game full screen on external display at regular 1080p, only slightly reduced settings, and can play at a comfortable frame rate without my video chat flaking out. Win!I pushed it even harder by also streaming the *game* to Discord. That worked for a few minutes before it finally blue screened under the load. xD To its credit, it rebooted itself in what felt like 3 seconds I guess from the fast NVMe storage. Okay, so not gonna be a Twitch streamer with this, ha, but I can at least join the fun with my friends now.I imagine performance mode is horrible for battery, but whatev. I'm not usually doing anything too demanding away from my desk.If you're out there LG: I might have preferred your fully spec'd Gram 14 laptop, just with a touch screen. Or the 2-in-1, but with the ports of the laptop line.Overall, this quietly released laptop is a CHAMP. Lovin' it.",5
2652,LG,"have 14Z990-R, this is much better choice Background: Have 14-inch gram with i7 for a few years now (2019), it is still very usable, but the heat is the main issue (Thermal throttling, etc), and at this point, I miss my heavy 17'' because some task 14 is just too small (coding, a lot of document arrangement, work with 2 monitors,s, etc).I pick i5 in particular is due to the thermal (the only issue) and pretty sure I will keep this for over 5 years.-pros:1) light, I can pick up my laptop with index/thumb and often walk around with that.2) fingerprint login3) fairly good keyboard, it is not as good as XPS but I will take it4) Repairability, it is really simple laptop to replace, I plan to replace the battery-con1) too small, I think 15 will be just fine, the 14 is good but it is still lacking",5
2653,LG,Very fast and light This is the first time I've owned an LG computer and I am very impressed on its quality.The laptop is very light and the screen is very crisp and the touchscreen is very responsive.,5
2654,LG,"Nice laptop Very nice, fast, just what I needed",4
2655,LG,"Love. Light, fast, easy to set up and arrived quickly.No complaints as of yet.",5
2656,LG,Ease of use I am still getting used to the touch screen but I am going to love it.I already find the lap top to be a nice addition to my home!,5
2657,LG,"Fast, light weight, great battery Some of the reviews refer to what I would call a ""sticky"" touch screen that is not smooth all the time--they are correct but the touch screen is good, just not great. The picture clarity is very good, high res, good color. The number one thing I dislike about this otherwise awesome laptop is the audio sound---no clue why LG put the speakers on the bottom under the touchpad on each side corner. There is plenty of room on top and some space for speakers. Depending on how you set it and lay it on the surface, the volume can be muffled. The speakers seem good but are not in a good place. Must be how boards lay up and limit in the build of where they could go. Get some Bluetooth speakers if you want excellent audio to match the video. But if you don't listen to YouTube or watch Netflix or Prime, no problem but if you want to watch shows and movies you might be disappointed with the speakers as your only source.",5
2658,LG,"Super light I love this laptop! It is so lightweight, It is a lot lighter than a tablet. The download time is really quick and the screen is bright an crisp, excellent quality! Photos and videos are very clear and crisp. The sounds quality could be a little louder, especially if you are trying to watch a video. I love the touch screen option and the fingerprint security option. The battery is long lasting. Overall this is a great laptop. I highly recommend it. I like the light up keyboard, but to be honest. It isn’t something that I really benefit from, I never look at the keys when I am typing. But for someone who doesn’t know how to type, I can see how this would be really beneficial!! Looks pretty too!!!!",5
2659,LG,"Unstable WiFi This attractive laptop has a serious design flaw: It will not maintain a wifi connection.Do not buy this device if you need to use wifi, for it will drop the connection after about 15 minutes.Getting the connection back required restarting the computer.I should have checked consumer reports before buying, for their are hundreds of complaints on this issue.LG appears to have ignored them all.",1
2660,LG,Love this have been using my LG Gram for about a week now trying out all of the features and really testing it and putting it to use. I love the ease of use. It was very easy to figure out. I love that it also has a touch screen because sometimes I hate using a mouse on a laptop. The fingerprint sign on was so easy to set up and works right everytime and I love that it has that extra security. This is so amazing and I absolutely love it. I have been using it on and off for the week just checking facebook and email and little things like that and have not turned it off or charged it and it still is not out of battery which is amazing. It loads up really fast too. The graphics and picture on it are amazing. We have our own photography business and it really helps me edit my pictures easier too since I have the touchscreen option. The one issue I have is because I am using it for photography I have an SD card that I need to put in it and there is not spot for one which was really disappointing so I will need to find some kind of adaptor. Other than that I have no complaints though and love it. Also a really neat feature that I love is how lightweight it is so its easy to take anywhere and carry around. I was so shocked when I picked it up for the first time. You will not be disappointed with this laptop.,5
2661,LG,Buyer beware This laptop is very bad at connecting to wifi.,1
2662,LG,"The best laptop I have owned! #LGTechInsidersI have been using the LG Gram for quite a bit now, and during that time I had very little issues with it. This laptop has amazing processing power and graphics so it has been very convenient for me. It mostly runs very smoothly and quickly which is what I like about it. I can do my things more quickly with this laptop, so I also like that. The laptop also has a very simplistic design to it; the thin grey coat that covers most of it, the thin frame for the screen, and did I mention how light this laptop is? This laptop is remarkably light! It is easily portable and I had no problems moving it around, except for the fact that it feels like I can snap the thing in half with hardly any effort; especially for the screen. I also find it decent for gaming which is what I like about it as well. The battery life is great so I can do many things on it before having to charge it. The quality of the sound is decent as well. The sound is not distorted and can be very loud without poor quality of sound. Overall, it a great product and it is worth what you spend. I highly recommend it!",5
2663,LG,"Nice PC! I have been using a 17"" Toshiba during my College Studies, but it became time to upgrade since I've graduated.This is definitely an example of such- an excellent upgrade!",5
2664,LG,Overpriced to underperform. Overpriced and underpeforms. Returned it for the zephyrus g14 and I could not be happier.,1
2665,LG,"Amazing laptop! Bought this to replace an HP Envy laptop. While I liked the HP i did not like anything about HP service and vowed not to buy another. This was recommended by a friend and I am so glad she did. There are really only positives: it's lightweight, has a long battery life,did the initial start-up in a very short time, has a fingerprint sign-in (praise the Lord), starts up in a couple of seconds and has a touch screen. I simply love it. If I had to say one negative thing it would be very petty - I would like the plug for the AC on the opposite side. I recommend this laptop with no reservations.",5
2666,LG,Quick and easy Works well. No complaints. Had it over almost a year and I still feel it’s in great condition.,5
2667,LG,Don’t plan to use on arrival. Just trying to unbox and use. This photo represents most of my afternoon.,3
2668,LG,"Light and powerful! Super light, super fast, looong battery life. The fingerprint reader is hit or miss.. it’s all about holding your finger on the pad for precisely the right amount of time.. two seconds usually does it. If that fails it’s super easy and quick to sign in with a 4 digit code of your choosing. So glad I got this and not the Lenovo Thinkpad. I use a Thinkpad for work and it’s great.. a real workhorse, but this is just as good and lighter so it’s great for travel.",5
2669,LG,"Not durable, a lot of glitches, customer support is courteous but wasn't able to help Advertising claimed that it’s durable and passed MIL-STD 810G but on the very first travel it got severely scratched while being in safe laptop compartment of my backpack (please see photos attached). I’ve been having Lenovo T480 for 2 years and never had such issues with it despite it’s a full plastic.There are a lot of reproduceable and very annoying glitches:- Fingerprint sensor doesn’t work after resuming from sleep mode- USB-C charging doesn’t work when laptop is off (charging indicator blinks and nothing happens until laptop is on)- Laptop doesn’t get to sleep mode when USB-C charger is connected- Bluetooth mouse doesn’t let laptop to go into sleep mode and it can’t be switched off (checkbox in settings is grayed-out)Customer support wasn’t able to help with scratched case in any way, simply told that it’s not a warranty case.",1
2670,LG,"Light with a great screen. Wish I had gotten a Gen 10 cpu. the fingerprint reader is garbage, but I have large hands and work with them so my opinion is suspect. Get a the model with the video card and as much ram as you can afford. Other than that it has a grate screen, real good keyboard (for a 14 inch laptop) and a pleasure to carry.",4
2671,LG,"Excellent Product Lightweight, perfect for home school!!!",5
2672,LG,I like it I like itIt works but the finger reader does not work with my old coot fingers maybe my finger is worn out hitting the channel change button for the tv not sure,5
2673,LG,Norton pop Good laptop but because of frequent Norton popping and othersI recommend you not to buy it (annoying) go for apple no such weird pop notices or trying to sell you stuff in the middle of your work,4
2674,LG,Easy to handle Bought this for my brother for school. It is lightweight and easy to handle. It has an awesome battery life to last him throughout the day at school.,5
2675,LG,Still trying to figure it out??! The computer after 2 weeks of minimal use whenever you open it starts up with a loud annoying sound not musical something that is broken. The touch pad it difficult to move at time I wonder if it refurbished though it did not stated that on purchase. It am forced to use a mouse.,3
